A man falls in love with a beautiful girl named Nancy and leaves her to die in the cold wilderness of Oregon. The only thing more beautiful than death, then, would be leaving someone to die...<|endoftext|>It's been a busy few weeks for us. This morning, we announced that our open source fork of the Chrome for Android is now stable with a new Android build. A couple of hours later, we sent out a blog post for beta testing and have now sent out a bunch of press release emails to our beta users. We've received a few requests, mostly from Google Nexus partners, but also from individuals who want to join the beta.

The email was sent out to Nexus and Pixel users, and also to the general public.

What are we beta testing this week?

In the Google Nexus group, for Android devices running Chrome 51 and higher, you will be able to download the Beta version of Chrome for Android 2.1. This beta should be available to all users at some point this week.

You can download a copy of the Chrome Beta for Android here. It should be the same version of Chrome that we deliver to all our users for Android. If you aren't currently receiving it, you can get one at Google Play.
