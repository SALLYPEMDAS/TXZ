A Northern Hymn .

This is the first time the entire song was written by a member of the group.

I did a mock rehearsal for the song on Monday and the whole recording was held in the house on the 2nd floor of the studio.

The songs are:

The song lyrics for this song

The song lyrics for "We're All In This Together"

This song has been recorded under the supervision of an instrumental engineer for over a year now.

We recorded the tune using several different instruments at different recording studios. I've been working on a bunch of these recordings at this point. We have very few songs on this song and have tried to keep things on a tight budget to pay for production and to do the songs themselves. However, if you want to hear the whole song, you can check out the video I posted on youtube.

Please let me know how this song turned out on your website!<|endoftext|>This article is part of the BBC's 'Newsnight' programme. Subscribe to Newsnight for all the latest news and information on how the BBC uses technology and culture.

The US National Security Agency is collecting information on US people and businesses by tapping into its vast surveillance power, a senior  US government official says.

"NSA has been collecting the very information the NSA has been collecting on American citizens and businesses, from the phones they have on their laptops and from the home, to the digital networks in every person's home," William Binney, former US ambassador to Britain and the US secretary of state under President George W Bush, told the Guardian in a phone interview.

He said the NSA, based at the Central Intelligence Agency, uses the communications information gleaned from electronic communication to compile more about people in the US, who, he said, could be targets for targeted abuse.

"They have been gathering very high-powered data and looking for people in our country who are not on the list and who have had their fingerprints on their phones," Binney said.

On Friday Binney and other officials said an internal NSA study suggested some users of Skype were using the service and that they also carried out "targeting" of their users. Binney also said a US government document leaked by Wikileaks was also to show NSA's use of Skype was illegal in the UK.

In an interview with the Guardian a source with knowledge of the report said the NSA uses these "sources and methods" to gather information
