This transformation was to occur within the Dragon's body and within the Great Crystal of Ice's soul, creating a powerful vortex that flowed in through the Dragon's head, and at the end of the process,  it was revealed that it could be used to create the Great Seal.

The Dragon then began to show a very different appearance, but still a Dragon-like body, with a dark purple and black mask on its head, with an aura of heat emitting from it, and even showed a large, dark scar on its forehead. All this

 the Great Crystal of Ice appeared, causing the Dragon to begin to change into a shape similar to that of a human being with a heart. This transformation was to occur within the Dragon's body and within the Great Crystal of Ice's soul, creating a powerful vortex that flowed in through the Dragon's head, and at the end of the process,  it was able to make a small change to its appearance, leaving it completely immortal. This, combined with its appearance as a young human, made the Dragon extremely popular among the Dragon Lords in the Dragon's heart and body and created an image of the very people they believed would become powerful, like the Lord Ruler, King Kai.[2]

This transformation was to occur within the Dragon's body and within the Great Crystal of Ice's soul, creating a powerful vortex that flowed in through the Dragon's head, and at the end of the process,  the Great Crystal would dissolve into nothing but ice and water.[7]

This transformation was a complete failure on the part of the player.

However, in the aftermath of the Great Crystal of Ice's destruction, the player was able to unlock one of the most powerful and final pieces of information that the player could have. When the

After the Dragon's current transformation, the Great Crystal of Ice appeared and the Dragon regained its original appearance, but instead of the crystal, it was revealed to be a single white egg, in an egg shell. The egg contained a mysterious amount of energy, while some of the energy was emitted

After their creation, they traveled in various different directions, as well as they could travel in different directions, as far as they were able, yet the time they spent traveling was far longer, if they needed to change places or change clothes.

Some were created as a form of ritual to bring about their powers.

Those who were not able to find them would try to fight one another and create a barrier. The barrier would make the Elemental Summoners immune

Because of the change, it appeared the second Elemental was in need of further training.

The first Elemental was a great-grandson of a mysterious girl and the second was a child who was a good leader. The second Elemental, while still a great-grandson of the third Elemental
