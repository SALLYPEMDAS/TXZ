----, an Indian-Pakistani scholar and former director of the Institute of International Relations at University of Iowa (IIRI), said the country is facing the toughest economic crisis since the 1990s.

"India is facing a severe economic crisis that has left many of its workforce without jobs, and is a major source of poverty," said Salman Khanna, professor  emeritus of foreign affairs at the IIRI.

"India's government could simply stop spending and invest in its infrastructure to tackle this issue and just get on with it."

India needs the world's $7 trillion infrastructure investment, as well as the $18 trillion investment required to build its own electricity grid, Mr Khanna said.
