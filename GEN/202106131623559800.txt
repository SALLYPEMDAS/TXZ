I'm watching you.

I'm watching you. 

"I'm watching you right now. It's okay."

"It's okay to see. This is not normal."

It wasn't until a few days later, when we were talking about having a good time, that I realized that this was the first time we were at this point in our lives.

I asked why she'd told me about that.

"I never knew who she was. I was so afraid."

She looked at me with a cold, unspoken smile. "I didn't think you liked me. Don't you think you'll be happy?"

I smiled back. "I did. I thought that you hated me."

Her lips parted, and a hand touched mine, pressing gently onto mine. "Do you ever feel sad when you think about me?"

I didn't really know what to say, but I couldn't help but think that maybe I should be saying it anyway. She didn't seem to be the kind of person I thought she would be, but now that I've understood how to express myself, I was able to understand how she felt about me without feeling embarrassed or guilty.

"I do. I always had a lot of bad feelings about you. When we met, I just wanted you to be happy."

I looked at her again, confused. "Well, you're not sad right now. You're just happy. You don't have to change."

Her hand didn't move, but

Her hand didn't move, but  she looked at me, giving me a hint. "It isn't like that at all. You have a purpose for this world. There's no one else."

I could feel the small smile spreading across my face, and felt it start to get bigger, starting to hold on to me even more. "I don't know if I want to hear about your loss. You don't want to talk about it with me anymore. You just want to be safe, to be happy."

I tried to pretend that she was still alive, but when I looked down at the floor, I could see tears running down her face.

I looked back at her, shocked. I wondered what I would think of a person like her now. But then again, the fact that she told me so, I wondered if it'd be something I would feel happy about.

I held her hand as she sat down. I looked down at the ceiling for a moment, just to make sure she was okay.

"You are really nice to me."

I reached down and touched her. She wasn't even able to look away from me, so I just stood there.

"I wanted to say something to you, but then I saw you staring at me from behind, and it just made me angry."

"What did you see? Didn't you know I was looking at you like a child?"

I took a deep breath. "What I see in you is me."
