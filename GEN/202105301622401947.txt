However, both of those who were involved in the attack are currently in jail. According to The New York Times, an investigation has found that North Korea has a long history of human rights abuses and is also in danger of nuclear warfare.

North Korea is reportedly also trying to find a way to change its nuclear deterrent into a mobile weapon with an advanced ballistic missile, according to The Daily Telegraph.

The United States and South Korea have previously condemned North Korea's actions, with President Barack Obama saying during a meeting of South Korea's leaders that "these actions constitute a grave violation of the United States' commitments to stand by the regime of North Korea," in the latest development in a series of missile tests and a military exercise on Tuesday, with the US Navy and US Army deploying to South Korea.

The attack comes just as North Korea is reportedly considering the possibility of testing a hydrogen bomb, something the United States has already said has no civilian use.

South Korea has already expressed  concern about the possibility of a hydrogen bomb or nuclear war, saying they have to "get used to it."

The United States has offered to help North Korea build a nuclear weapon by putting its own missiles on standby, as well as by providing its own ballistic missile system. The North's previous ballistic missile tests have been halted as part of an international agreement over its nuclear program.

U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned that the United States will not tolerate an unprovoked nuclear attack. "The question is what kind of weapons can we use to threaten a region that would otherwise be more peaceful," Kerry said.

North Korea has been testing nuclear weapons for more than 60 years, using them to test missiles and launch ballistic missiles. A U.S. spy agency has said it has evidence Pyongyang has nuclear weapons that could make a deadly strike on the United States.
