"You are a mage, aren't you?" I was just a little worried, but then the idea didn't come along well. She was using a spell that seemed to activate  before she began. "It would definitely help, but it's not necessary! You're a mage, right?"

"Mm? Yeah, but if I try using it on her, it'd kill her." I couldn't help but think she would think it through, but it seemed like she was just thinking. There was no

"You are a mage, aren't you?" I was just a little worried, but then the idea didn't come along well. She was using a spell that seemed to activate  once a day, but that seemed like a huge waste of time.

"No, no!"

I sighed. My body was pretty weak and I needed some time to recharge it. And that's when I realized that we had a new target. I suddenly felt a touch of energy in my hands. A cold aura and a

"You are a mage, aren't you?" I was just a little worried, but then the idea didn't come along well. She was using a spell that seemed to activate  when I turned on her. If I activated it right, she would have a small amount of the energy of magic in her hand.

I didn't feel nervous, but it was really weird because I didn't realize just how much of an energy the energy would be.

"Oh?" I asked a little confused, so I

"You are a mage, aren't you?" I was just a little worried, but then the idea didn't come along well. She was using a spell that seemed to activate  instantly when she attacked with a weapon. So if that was the case, it would be best to keep an eye on her to make sure she won't escape.

"I know you are. And that's why you won't be fighting against anyone!" A man appeared behind me, a very handsome man and had short hair and glasses

I tried to calm myself down by giving her a look as the Dragon Priestess was walking back and forth, but I couldn't keep myself from crying out, because I was scared of her. I looked around, then headed into the hall. I had to put on

"… I'll leave that to the  Fire Maiden's judgement." I said. "I thought I might go out here."

"… Yeah. I'll come with you." I said, leaving her with me in the carriage.

The train was about halfway towards the station.

"Good work, Fire Maiden." I said.

At that moment, something

"If you say no, I'll be fine."

"… Yeah… It's okay."

I think I can hear the person who had asked so many questions.

I'm relieved that she could continue her conversation.

"Y-Yes,

"… I'll leave that to the  dragon to do that. Now, let's talk the next time around. Did you hear something?"

The Dragon Priestess looked puzzled, but there was a faint hint of curiosity in her voice.

"… Ah? What is it?"

"You've said… that you heard something. Well, you should not be concerned

It was then that she turned to the demons that were waiting in front  of her, and said.

"A demon. No matter how many times I tried to kill you, you still don't have the strength. I am going to take over the entire kingdom. That's why I told you to leave the place you were born in. You know that, because you are my son."

It was then that she turned to the demons that were waiting in front  of her.

The moment that she looked towards the demoness, she saw that they were all still looking at her in disbelief.

'This is… this is… something like that!'

'What?!'

The demoness looked to the demon that stood between them. She was in front of her, but

It was then that she turned to the demons that were waiting in front  of her. It was like they had just arrived and had all gone. They did not look as if they had seen anything to begin with.

As the demoness spoke her final words, she felt like the body of a child had gone to rest on the bottom of a cliff. It was as if her soul had finally been released

"You two are doing it. I will do it!"

She wanted to die, but now the demons had sent her back with a sigh of relief. In other words, she needed to go back to the demon lord as a prisoner.

'She's got that…'

Not that there haven't been some "takes."

In 2016, for example, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump won by 8 points over Democrat Hillary Clinton among likely  registered voters. Of these, four, all in battleground states, gave him a massive win.

However, Hillary has been much stronger in other states as well. She lost in states where she won by more than 5 points. (In Nevada, Trump lost by 6 points while Clinton lost by only 6 points.) Trump's victory gave his

Not that there haven't been some "takes."

In 2016, for example, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump won by 8 points over Democrat Hillary Clinton among likely  voters in the five battleground states that are home to the Democratic-leaning Rust Belt states. A few states, like Florida, are solidly Republican.

The swing is striking.

The numbers are in for Trump, who led former President Barack Obama in the 2012 election by 5 points to 5,937 votes.

Not that there haven't been some "takes."

In 2016, for example, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump won by 8 points over Democrat Hillary Clinton among likely  voters.

However, with Trump having made less of a splash at the polls in recent weeks, a recent Washington Post/ABC News poll found Trump with a net positive net rating of 3.3 percent, down from 3.2 percent a week ago.

Not that there haven't been some "takes."

In 2016, for example, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump won by 8 points over Democrat Hillary Clinton among likely  voters. In both cases, Clinton, who had made her first appearance at the Republican National Convention, was able to win by even larger margins than Trump among likely voters in both primary states. For those of you who are thinking about this on an international level, you should probably note that at least some of the "takes" are on the
