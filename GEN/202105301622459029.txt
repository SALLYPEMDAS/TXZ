The Spirit Underneath  the Mountain, Volume 2, Chapter 23

The first verse of the novel is from a chapter of The Mountain of Geryon, from which the Book of Mormon comes. (As the Book of Mormon was an actual book, so I would presume the first part of the book is the first two verses.) There is more here, but if you look carefully at the first couple verses, you'll notice it says things like: "It is not possible for men to know in what state of mind God is while he is with them; rather, God is with us because our hearts are like the hearts of those who were made perfect by God the Father."

The second verse of the novel is the last one. It states: "But all things shall be made known unto you in the beginning. And ye shall know that all things are in the beginning. And they which were made known unto you are not, nor are they in the beginning, neither shall they be in the beginning, nor are they in the beginning, neither shall they be in the beginning, neither shall they be in the beginning, neither shall they be in the beginning, neither shall they be in the beginning, and ye shall know that they are in the beginning."

And they which were made known unto you are not, nor are they in the beginning, neither shall they be in the beginning, nor are they in the beginning, neither shall they be in the beginning, neither shall they be in the beginning, neither shall they be in the beginning, neither shall they be in the beginning, and ye shall know that they are in the beginning." It has  four lines: "And all things will be made known unto you in the beginning"; "But ye shall know that all things are in the beginning." And so it begins: "But all things are made known unto you in the beginning." The fifth line: "And ye shall know that all things are in the beginning." It says: "For as men were made, so also do ye know that they are in the beginning."

The fourth section of the novel says: "But they that were made known unto you in the beginning, are not in the beginning, neither shall they be in the beginning, neither shall they be in the beginning." It says: "And ye shall know that they are in the beginning." And so it concludes: "And ye shall know that they are in the beginning."

So what I think the Book of Mormon writers were trying to say, however, is that the Book of Mormon is an actual bookâ€”not a statement made to me. The first verse of the novel, in fact, is the last. The words here are: "But ye shall know that they are in the beginning." And so it says: "And ye shall know that they are in the beginning."
