Many of the birds were bred into a family called the "honey-birds" – and later domesticated from birds, too – by their masters – the British Royal Society.

They came to Australia around 8,000 years ago and evolved to have special skin folds, which help them hide from  predators, while avoiding the harsh glare of the sun.
