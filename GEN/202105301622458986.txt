But now, a Canadian federal court has changed the rules and allowed the public to see the financial details of your spending, whether you have any debts or income.

In a ruling this morning, Justice Susan Rehm said the data show the government is still required to report certain facts about your spending.

The ruling was announced by Rehm's office following a two-day trial in Calgary where her office is seeking a stay of a decision, according to The Canadian Press.

"This Court has held that it is a reasonable expectation that the records will be disclosed to Canadians and their representatives. Therefore, if the Government believes that it has obtained the relevant information and has not given it to the public, it must disclose it, subject to the requirements of article 40,"

It's being used by the government to conduct a cross-country review of its own finances, according to a decision filed by Canada's Attorney General Michael Ferguson at the Supreme Court in Edmonton.

"The government believes that the audit will have a large impact on the integrity of Canadian financial management and its operations and will result in the loss of some taxpayers' money," said the Attorney General's Office in the ruling, published today by the Canadian Press.
