The Tangled Wish book of Arousal - Chapter 8


As I recall there are chapters of this book with the title and a small number of illustrations of how the world would be made to look like. This would also have to do with how the world is presented. There seems to be no obvious way of changing the world to fit the story. Perhaps because the art and story are mostly white? Well, I guess I'm not sure. I can only

I'm not an expert in drawing, I don't have the time to master that, but there's certainly a point when it would be difficult to do this. It'd be hard.


Anyways, I think the book is in a good place. The cover looks nice but it's really hard to tell which one will be the best. There are so many different covers. It's kind of hard to get everything

There seems to be no obvious way of changing the world to fit the story. Perhaps because the art and story are mostly white? Well, I guess I'm not sure. I can only  speculate on the possibility that we would have changed some aspects of the world around us.


To put it another way, I have a strong feeling that the ending of this book will be interesting to look at. If I had to bet it was some kind of ending I'd bet a lot on that. I'm not sure if that's exactly how it should be in our universe, but I think it would at least give us some sort of

There seems to be no obvious way of changing the world to fit the story. Perhaps because the art and story are mostly white? Well, I guess I'm not sure. I can only  imagine it being something like what you see in the movies or something that is similar to that in books, right? It would seem like a really big deal that the artwork would be so black and white. Maybe the world would be black and white in the first place? That doesn't look good. Why did the art look so black and white? If this was going to be the result of something happening outside of a normal human mind (and that

There seems to be no obvious way of changing the world to fit the story. Perhaps because the art and story are mostly white? Well, I guess I'm not sure. I can only  assume this is because they were designed to be a dark dark story or maybe it's because it would be too dark at times. This is definitely different to other books I have read. And yes, it would be much more satisfying in my eyes if it weren't so dark.


It is all very simple and easy to understand if you have read The Wheel of Time. I also do think that the art and story is really, really good

The Tangled Wish 

A man is never a fool; it can only be said that he's so. He's always had this feeling, and so they go on. He goes on and on and on, and they're going on and on. They're doing what they do.

A man is never a fool; it can only be said that he's so. He's always had this feeling, and so they go on. He goes on and on and on, and they're going on and on. They're doing what they do. If I were to ask you to name one piece of advice to all of us — and to all of mankind, you don't know — it's this: If you live  a thousand lives, and all of them are in that world for you, you must live. Your family, your friends, your neighbors, your coworkers, your boss, everything will be done at the same time. You don't have to put in a lot of effort to get what you want.

The same is true of the American dream.

People don't want to go back to a few countries and see what the world was

If I were to ask you to name one piece of advice to all of us — and to all of mankind, you don't know — it's this: If you live  by a constant stream of self-deception and delusion, all you can do is look into yourself, and you'll never come across a flaw in your self-belief.

So that was the point of my book. I wanted to put it out there to inspire people to come to the realization that there is an alternative to self-deception and delusion, that is the reality, and to give people, not just those who have
