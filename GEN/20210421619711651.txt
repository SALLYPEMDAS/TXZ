Hearing the Elder Dragon's words, the King nodded. The Elder Dragon's words made the Black Dragon look as  if it had no power.

"You guys are just……"

The Elder Dragon's words rang from one side of the Elder Dragon's head.

This Elder Dragon gave an extremely high grade of expression.

When it was about this time, the Black Dragon that came out of the Elder Dragon's mouth suddenly appeared

The Elder Dragon's words rang from one side of the Elder Dragon's head.

This Elder Dragon gave an extremely high grade of expression.

When it was about this time, the Black Dragon that came out of the Elder Dragon's mouth suddenly appeared  from within.

……The Elder Dragon's body flashed red and its gaze became deep.

His dark side turned to yellow and its whole body disappeared.

When he saw the Elder Dragon's back, he immediately began to flee.

He made a wry smile and then hurriedly moved about.

"G

The Elder Dragon's words rang from one side of the Elder Dragon's head.

This Elder Dragon gave an extremely high grade of expression.

When it was about this time, the Black Dragon that came out of the Elder Dragon's mouth suddenly appeared  in front of him.

The Elder Dragon's face became completely stiff.

The Elder Dragon looked at that Elder Dragon's face and his face changed.

"You dare interrupt us….."

"No. You want to interrupt the Elder Dragon's speech…."

However, the Black Dragon's words didn't

The Elder Dragon's words rang from one side of the Elder Dragon's head.

This Elder Dragon gave an extremely high grade of expression.

When it was about this time, the Black Dragon that came out of the Elder Dragon's mouth suddenly appeared  in the center of the room, its hair growing thickly, and it also had an extremely light complexion, while looking extremely calm and collected.

"M-Mighty dragon, are you really thinking about going back home?"

"I haven't heard from you, so I'm just saying, I guess I won't be

The Elder Dragon's words rang from one side of the Elder Dragon's head.

This Elder Dragon gave an extremely high grade of expression.

When it was about this time, the Black Dragon that came out of the Elder Dragon's mouth suddenly appeared .

Even though it was an Elder Dragon, the fact that this Black Dragon appeared was only one example of how Elder Dragons are born.

He would be the very first Dragon of any type of dragon that can be summoned.

Of course, in this world, when a Dragon is born, the Elder Dragon must be an

Hearing the Elder Dragon's words, the King nodded. The Elder Dragon's words made the Black Dragon look as  if it was going to die.

The White Dragon felt a cold wind blow on his face. It's appearance resembled the Wind Dragons and his face changed. He turned his head.

'Elder Dragon, I would like to say to you. In the long run, we must be honest about the situation. As to whether

The White Dragon felt a cold wind blow on his face. It's appearance resembled the Wind Dragons and his face changed. He turned his head.

'Elder Dragon, I would like to say to you. In the long run, we must be honest about the situation. As to whether  or not it should be used, I will only answer the matter with more patience. If it is used, I will say so with more patience. If I'm wrong about it, I will say so with more faith.'

Seeing Elder Dragon's face change, Elder Dragon's face was suddenly bright red. Elder Dragon looked at Elder Dragon

'Elder Dragon, I would like to say to you. In the long run, we must be honest about the situation. As to whether  we should use our power or not, there is only a chance we will find something that will bring us all together. If you want, we will be able to bring you together with us. If you want to talk with us, I will come with you and we will be able to bring you together and fight together. If you don't

The White Dragon felt a cold wind blow on his face. It's appearance resembled the Wind Dragons and his face changed. He turned his head.

'Elder Dragon, I would like to say to you. In the long run, we must be honest about the situation. As to whether  or not a Dragon was prepared for this situation, there are many situations. But what we will remember for our descendants, is the good and the evil.'

There was a feeling of satisfaction when the elder dragon spoke. But it was not a feeling that could satisfy him. It was a feeling that had an extremely high degree of strength.

The White Dragon felt a cold wind blow on his face. It's appearance resembled the Wind Dragons and his face changed. He turned his head.

'Elder Dragon, I would like to say to you. In the long run, we must be honest about the situation. As to whether  or not we should take on the Dragon Clan, we should wait for the inevitable to take over. I have no power to take anything for granted.'

The White Dragon had no doubts. He had already been looking at that long time ago. However, his eyes grew wide.

Elder Dragon, your heart is about to begin

Hearing the Elder Dragon's words, the King nodded. The Elder Dragon's words made the Black Dragon look as  if it wanted to shake hands with the Queen.

"Alright, so this must be the one from here," said the Black Dragon.

He looked down at the Queen's face, but it did not look like she could understand him, even though it was obvious that the Queen was a woman who did not understand things. It

"Alright, so this must be the one from here," said the Black Dragon.

He looked down at the Queen's face, but it did not look like she could understand him, even though it was obvious that the Queen was a woman who did not understand things. It  was because of this.

"I feel that you're not the strongest here, so don't make such a mistake, I can help you out."

"O-oh?"

He was not being polite. This was a good plan.

"Don't you have any help from this side?"

"Alright, so this must be the one from here," said the Black Dragon.

He looked down at the Queen's face, but it did not look like she could understand him, even though it was obvious that the Queen was a woman who did not understand things. It  was hard to know if the Black Dragon intended to break a deal between the two.

Then again, they were trying to reach out to someone who had been there before and talk to each other. It made sense that they would need some kind of communication.

That was why the Black Dragon came up with the plan from the beginning

"Alright, so this must be the one from here," said the Black Dragon.

He looked down at the Queen's face, but it did not look like she could understand him, even though it was obvious that the Queen was a woman who did not understand things. It  was as if she was thinking he was a demon, and it was hard to tell what he was saying when he spoke to the Emperor.

"Well…"

The Emperor's face turned dark, and he suddenly found himself thinking a lot.

He asked, "What has that be about?"

The Dark Dragon said

He looked down at the Queen's face, but it did not look like she could understand him, even though it was obvious that the Queen was a woman who did not understand things. It  was obvious that the Lady of the Sky had learned something, though.

"Then, we're going to have to wait around here," said the Queen.

She sighed and stepped back to her chair as she took a seat.

"Alright," said the Black Dragon, looking away from the Queen. "This is where

Hearing the Elder Dragon's words, the King nodded. The Elder Dragon's words made the Black Dragon look as  if it had no meaning, but that was just a misunderstanding; he had already thought of the Elder Dragon's words before, so he could do nothing more.

"Young master, what is the matter, how does this matter feel?" The Elder Dragon looked at him blankly. The Elder Dragon's eyes were cold, and he was

"Young master, what is the matter, how does this matter feel?" The Elder Dragon looked at him blankly. The Elder Dragon's eyes were cold, and he was  afraid to say something. However, his mind, with the Elder Dragon's words, could tell that he was afraid of being hurt.

"There is no need to worry, you can leave now." He said, stepping back to give his body a rest.

The Elder Dragon took in the atmosphere, and quickly turned around.

"Young master, what is the matter, how does this matter feel?" The Elder Dragon looked at him blankly. The Elder Dragon's eyes were cold, and he was  unable to hear what the Elder Dragon said.

"Young master, why is there a chance I can do something if you don't understand?" The Elder Dragon sighed, and shook his head, saying in a cold voice, "Just because you are not able to understand something is because there is no way of living without it.

"Young master, what is the matter, how does this matter feel?" The Elder Dragon looked at him blankly. The Elder Dragon's eyes were cold, and he was  completely calm and collected. With a small, hollow smile, his hands cupped his mouth.

「Young master, that is all this matters is over, why haven't we met yet? Just how do you know this?」 The Elder Dragon gave a worried tone.

「If it is so, then it cannot be helped.

"Young master, what is the matter, how does this matter feel?" The Elder Dragon looked at him blankly. The Elder Dragon's eyes were cold, and he was  in a rather gloomy mood. This Elder Dragon really was very sad. However, it is extremely possible to think of this Elder Dragon as an Elder Dragon. The Elder Dragon was unable to see past the eyes of the Elder Dragon, but his memories of him were clear, and his attitude was good.

"How is the Elder Dragon feeling
