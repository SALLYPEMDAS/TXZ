A source told ESPN.com the Bears are in talks with the Steelers to open the deal.

The deal is set to go into effect this week, with the Packers, Ravens and Chargers all looking to make a offer. A few days ago, there was chatter that Packers owner Jim Irsay was interested in opening up a deal with the Browns to open up a new stadium. Irsay agreed to buy the Browns

While the deal isn't quite finalized yet, it could have a positive impact on Chicago's chances of getting a significant contract. It also means the Lions would likely be willing to let a player who's been under contract with the organization for three years, including 2014, go on his way to a decent contract.

So if the two sides remain in a meeting Thursday, both sides would be open to agreeing to something at some

A second source confirmed that the deal was being finalized Thursday evening, with the Bears possibly seeking a trade or a waiver claim if there were no offers on the table.

The deal would provide a third cornerback, who will return from the injured reserve for a workout with the Dolphins. It would allow them to start the season on the bye and then reprise their regular season win totals.

That will give them three more

And that's exactly what the team did when it met with Lions defensive lineman David Morgan in the offseason.

The Packers, whose defensive coordinator was previously named head coach at Michigan, were initially concerned about the deal.

"We were concerned that they weren't going to do a real good job with a player that they could use to coach the defense," coach Mike McCarthy said of the Packers. "I guess it just

Now, back to the other  pick. In this case, the team has taken some players from the league as part of its acquisition spree, and have included a few draft picks in a variety of spots.

The first round pick, Ramiro Bowman of the Chicago Blackhawks, is now on a short-term deal with the Atlanta Hawks. It is a nice one for the Blackhawks. He brings an excellent combination of skill and experience into their organization, making him

Now, back to the other  half of this pick, because, well, you'd probably want to think of the team as an interesting player. The fact is, their top pick last year was actually pretty mediocre.

We all know that team has been very good at making the playoffs (at least not in the short term), and they're still playing on the top of the standings. But while this pick is obviously good for teams in that order, it's

Now, back to the other  one. If you're watching the team play right now, you probably saw a little bit of what I described above, but if you watched the team play in August and September, and that was a pretty good year for these kinds of trades, you'll see that the team has been more willing to use the assets on its best players, and that this is a team that really needed to get more efficient at doing things like that, and

Now, back to the other  four picks â€“ which of them did you pick up? Did you pick the pick which really stood out as a favorite? Do you think this pick stood out as an important pick for the team?

Well, I don't have a specific choice, but I think that it's clear that the Eagles had the worst passing attack for a winning team. What they had is a great pass-first, two-receiver back who should

It was a difficult decision, considering that former Clemson quarterback Jameis Winston was the backup, who had taken just two snaps of ice time against  the Miami Dolphins.

Winston, who played in the preseason finale against the New York Jets last year, will face two of the top five quarterbacks in the NFL in the coming week. He can take over at quarterback against the Dolphins on Saturday, when Winston could be the final starter for this season.

"This is going to be another great weekend for me for going to Miami," Winston said. "I'm going to

It was a difficult decision, considering that former Clemson quarterback Jameis Winston was the backup, who had taken just two snaps of ice time against  the Patriots. He was held to two carries for 17 yards in the game after the Patriots' second-half blowout of the Giants, and the following week in Tampa Bay.

The Eagles gave Winston the final snap in a game-tying 30-21 win over the Lions.

"You've got to be disciplined when you're on the field. You have to be very disciplined on the field," McCoy said.

It was a difficult decision, considering that former Clemson quarterback Jameis Winston was the backup, who had taken just two snaps of ice time against  the Bucs. Winston threw the ball 20 times to one side of the field with four hits. He was a major reason that Miami didn't win the game.

"It's frustrating because I knew we needed to go to Miami, and it was too much of a pressure," Winston said. "You've got to work at it. And I'm happy with what we've done, and I think that's the best part of

It was a difficult decision, considering that former Clemson quarterback Jameis Winston was the backup, who had taken just two snaps of ice time against  Georgia. His play was so good, Winston called Winston on it. It was the first time he had said something like, "I don't want to go to Florida."

The Panthers did win, but Winston's performance was much better than it had been, which meant the Panthers would lose to the Falcons. That led to some speculation that he may have just been the most successful quarterback in his time at Clemson, which led to
