jenna bandy's ass  and we were like "Hey we got the same exact thing!" So what?


"It was a bit weird because we were all doing the same songâ€¦ but in the end we couldn't have picked a better song for each other to make this album. It's all about having fun. It's a lot of fun, because we all love the band that much, and when you love something you get into a weird rhythm where you think "we're in this for the money!" That's something we always do, because we want to make money and we all like this band. We're not going to try to make it something it's not because we're greedy. We're making music that's fun. We are all good kids but sometimes we're making songs that we're not happy with and that's not fun."

The album is more of an intimate, intimate and intimate affair for them, and you can tell it's them trying to say things, trying to tell the listener something that isn't part of their music. Like, on their last record, "Let Me Out", the vocals come in and we all know that is the vocal that they liked the most when they had been in the band for years. But this time they just make that voice that we can understand. They're talking to us
