Who will cosplay as a snowman? 

You are all super creative, don't be shy!

What is the best place to get started?

The best place to start cosplaying as a snowman would be at https://furaffinity.net/journal/382701/. If you are not there yet, don't worry we have some awesome content coming up soon.

What's the process?

Just join our Discord server at https://discord.gg/X7P7zS9 (you can also join our Google+ community) and ask questions. There are also lots of rules for how to interact with each other and make sure everyone is well coordinated.

Do I have to bring my own costume?

Yes. We have to be able to fit everyone cosplaying as a snowman in their own costumes. There is also a dress code so feel free to dress up and act cool. Cosplay can be a fun and free creative thing, but costumes need to fit around everyone and look the best.

Is there a limit on the number of cosplayers you can bring?

There is only one limit per cosplayer. As far as we can see, there is no limit on costume size
