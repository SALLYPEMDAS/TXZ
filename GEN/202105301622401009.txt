And I have a feeling it's going to be a really interesting series. It's about an intergalactic police force. And this story is so weird. There's  one particular character and the story is so weird. So I'll have to get a handle on that first time I read. I will be honest. And then you have that guy who you see on TV, and you see the kind of person that you see in movies. And there's so much more.

AVC: You've made it clear for me now that you're definitely not done, and that there are still some things in the works, and even with the release of the book, there is still a lot of room for improvement.

WILLIAMS: That's right. We have to get that to work. That would mean bringing back the whole story, to reprise that story in the next issue. We have to get that sort of depth and to find those things. And the big deal with comics, you can't do something like that without going out and getting it. [laughs] I know there are some people who are going to love comics. And I'm saying this for the first time. And I don't want to be too technical or too complex. I think it's going to be quite fun. But I do wish there were more places to do this in comics. It would

AVC: Do you think there will be more people doing comics or do you just want people who love the art to read it?

WILLIAMS: Not at this point. We have to work with some artists, some people who like to do comics and some people who love to work with comics. And so there is going to be a bit of crossover between the two genres, but I think there will be a lot more, and we are all going to look to find ways to create more, because we're going to do more and more stuff together. And then there is all this stuff going to be released that is going to be totally different. And we will do it in a similar way, but also in the same way and different ways.

AVC: What is the final chapter of the book?

WILLIAMS: I want to finish it on time. I just started that whole story a little bit. I did just a quick short on my own.
