The letter from General James B. Mattis, commander of the US Army's Eastern Command, has been forwarded to the Pentagon and sent to the Office of the Deputy Secretary of Defense and to the White House, the Pentagon said.

Mattis' remarks, issued Thursday morning, also raised concerns that US military officials were providing a "political cover" for US special operations forces involved in fighting ISIL.

The letter was written to Pentagon Director Chuck Hagel, and sent on February 27.

Mattis was quoted by Reuters saying: "We have been working with Somalia's armed forces for several years on a strategy to bring the terrorists to the aid of these forces. We have agreed to coordinate, coordinate with others in the region to support them if they go forward as intended and provide financial support

Mattis was quoted by Reuters saying: "We have been working with Somalia's armed forces for several years on a strategy to bring the terrorists to the aid of these forces. We have agreed to coordinate, coordinate with others in the region to support them if they go forward as intended and provide financial support , training and intelligence and advice."

The letter, which has since been forwarded to the White House, is the latest example of a "new and improved" way for a US military operation to gain support for a coalition fighting ISIL.

"We are aware that some US military advisers have been provided with material that has been used by ISIL to support this operation, and are working to understand the issue," Gen. Michael S. Rogers, commander of US forces in Somalia, told The Associated Press via e-mail.

Rogers added: "We recognize that the US has a political motivation to help a foreign country, but that our actions cannot be limited to those that are assisting it and in fact will never be limited to those that are not. The US military's ability to support or cooperate with other countries will always remain as great a matter as the people and property of the people that are fighting us."

As the US military has developed into an integrated force, its resources, and the ability to support and train local groups, it is important that the military can get involved in the region and engage with other countries on a deeper and deeper scale, says Chris Dern, director of research at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
