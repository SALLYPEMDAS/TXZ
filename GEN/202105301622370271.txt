But even after A. R. B. has left the family, his father is still a slave  for their "good fortune". He would spend time in the streets, and was frequently asked to do so, even though his family could not. (The Book of Mormon) He would sometimes run into the young people and ask them what they thought of him or him's behavior. It was a typical example of an abuse that had taken place at the hands of someone he loved

This abusive relationship was not just between brothers, but was often caused by an older brother who might not have seen it coming. (Deuteronomy 12:12)


If this was a husband and wife relationship it would have been very hard to believe. After all, they were the very same people. (Proverbs 28:3-4
