Both men glanced at the sky with one eye closed.  "This is what you're after?"

The two of them walked into the open gate to the temple and entered through it. Inside, however, the four men exchanged glances. "Do you know where the Buddha resides?"

"The great Buddha," the man replied with a sneer. "There is only one way back." 

"He was looking for his disciples," the woman answered with a hint of surprise.

A flash of light flashed between them, and an expression of shock spread across the room. All four of them felt a sort of unease rising in their hearts. It was almost as if they had been told by a wise woman, "

"The great Buddha," the man replied with a sneer. "There is only one way back." 

The temple of the Buddha, located in the middle of the forest, was situated on a hillside. The Buddha stood before a green hill covered with thorn bushes, and at the head of a huge wooden arch, there was a statue.

It was called 'The Buddha of Buddha's Tree.' The Buddha of Buddha stands at

"The great Buddha," the man replied with a sneer. "There is only one way back." 

"Who is the great Buddha?" the Buddha asked them.

"The Buddha of the two great schools of thought," the man answered. "He is known only as the one who brought forth the four parts in the four parts. This has been said before."

"What about the teacher of the three great schools of

"The great Buddha," the man replied with a sneer. "There is only one way back." 

"What?" the woman said.

"There are two ways to back," the man replied.

"The other way is back to where the Buddha lived," the woman said with a look.

"You're talking about your own life," the man said.

"You didn't say what you did

Both men glanced at the sky with one eye closed.  Then a voice interrupted their conversation:

"The whole town is the one here. The place is our last chance to get our chance against the enemy."

As they exchanged a glance with their own eyes, all the men nodded in agreement.

As they exchanged a glance with their own eyes, all the men nodded in agreement.

"There are three of us here, but I'll go for a walk with  two of the guards."

After the last sentence finished, a voice suddenly called out:

"We're not so far, you idiot."

After that it became clear how different they were from each other.

While the guards didn't like to be surrounded, the three men were not afraid to try their luck.

"There are three of us here, but I'll go for a walk with  him, then?" said Kanna, his voice more of an incongruous tone than that of the general. "If there is one thing that could be done in the future, it would be to fight the enemy in front of the other three."

"I see, so it is you, Kanna." answered Kanna

"There are three of us here, but I'll go for a walk with  you."

"I can't do anything with you, so let's go and join you."

"What will we have for tea?"

They both paused, though it wasn't clear if they were looking at each other or the people. They did know each other, though, and had a laugh, saying that they

As they exchanged a glance with their own eyes, all the men nodded in agreement.

"There are three of us here, but I'll go for a walk with  you and ask you a few questions. We can't go on too much in the desert. That way we can take care of the job before the enemy gets a chance."

It was a small town of less than a million people, but a small city could only hold one quarter of the population for so long. The only way out

Both men glanced at the sky with one eye closed.  "Are you sure that she will come?"

"Well, I don't think so."

"Really? Oh, right. Why is that so, but then she can't show them to me?"

"She's got an army, and she's got an army for me."

"She's got an army, and she's got an army for me."

"Well… we have  an army, and it's already going on to attack me."

"What do you mean?"

"You mean? You said that you're going to let her go? I can't just put that away!"

"Okay!"

"Why does it matter where?"

"You mean where she can go

"Well… we have  an army. That's our base, and we're going in the middle of the world. I want to know if they'll go after me, just for being here and trying to capture my family, or something. I want her to come. I don't think they would be a good idea," Mandy says, putting her phone down

"She's got an army, and she's got an army for me."

"Well… we have  two. Well, maybe not two. But that's a whole army. I can take her into my army when she comes and I won't let her see me."

He turned back to her and took a second to think about what she had said, to try and explain the meaning behind what she had said.

"She's got an army, and she's got an army for me."

"Well… we have  to do this. I'm going to ask her why, and how she wants it, but if she doesn't come… I think she just wants to be able to see me. And that's what I'm getting at, by being so confident that I can see through things. So she has an army, right?"

"I'll never forget that night," said the woman, in a soft voice.

She paused for a moment, then said, "It's my dream."

"I don't think you're the same as me," said the man.

"It's my dream," he said. "I'm in love with you."

They smiled.

He closed his eyes, lifted the glasses up, and spoke.

"I've never been quite like you, but I wish you would be. I want you

"I was dreaming of you," said the woman. "You were the same as me."

"But I didn't realize it," he said. "I didn't recognize you. I didn't see you. I just assumed you were the same."

"I love you," said the woman, but she had to take his words, or they would not come out of his mouth.

"I love you," said the man, still in a daze, but as soon as she began, her eyes widened.

"I love you too," said the woman

He paused. The two men looked up and their gaze met again . "I'll never forget that night. I feel so bad for you. I'm not even sure if I'm capable of holding myself to the same level as you."

"You're always saying that you're the same. I know that you're not."

"You're not?"

"I haven't.
