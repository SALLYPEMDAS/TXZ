The U.S. military said Thursday that the man in question, a 31-year-old Sudanese citizen named Chad Carter, was among nine people held in solitary confinement by U. S. military forces at Camp Pendleton near Lake Pendleton, Calif., the Marine Corps said Thursday. That means five people in isolation are not allowed to contact their families and that the United States military has placed them under a program known as solitary confinement at Camp Pendleton.

S. military troops in Sudan's south since the beginning of this year. In the case of the other three people held by the U.S. government in Sudan, the soldiers have charged him with using "unlawful military tactics" against an anti-war activist group that has protested against the government's use of violence.

Chad is an ally of the Sudanese government, which has accused the Sudanese government of taking part in the operation.
