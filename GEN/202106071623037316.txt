At the beginning of July, a photo from the same spot showed the three-year-old boy wearing a shirt with the words "Bagdad" on it and was carrying a small baby. The caption said: "There is only one way to celebrate this moment." 

The photo prompted a tweet from an account that said: "This is why we love your baby girl @POTUS. Hope your baby girl is not as dark as I am!"

In the image, a man walks into a group of women who are wearing similar shirts but are wearing matching black hair
