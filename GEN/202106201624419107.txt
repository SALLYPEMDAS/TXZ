The fourth version of the world is a world known as Krypton, but it is different. It is home to the Dark Lord and his followers, with the only difference being that they are  the descendants of Krypton's children (who, like the humans in the show, do not live in Krypton, though the humans are part of the same group that lived in the universe at the time of Superman's birth).

The character of Batman will eventually be introduced in the next issue.
