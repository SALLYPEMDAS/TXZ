The Multidimensional Underwear Drawer 

This is the only part of the pack that has not been officially released yet but we've got it here. The front part has a zipper (no, not your standard zipper). It's the only part that will include a belt, a zipper, a button, a bag, and maybe some of the other stuff that we have in there.

The backpack also has a leather strap which I think has been a problem for a while now. But it's still okay. It's also cool to have an extra zip if you're going to be carrying around all sorts of stuff that are on your back.

The back cover and the back of the pack itself are all very similar to the Backpack X and the back of the backpack are a little more different.

The main issue you will see if you get to the front and back is the fact that the cover is a little too tight. You will also find that it's still a little bit uncomfortable to hold. We've seen this on more of the pack this year so the best place to start is under the covers and back covers.

Another issue I noticed was that the strap of the backpack doesn't actually fit on the pockets. I found it on the bottom

Another issue I noticed was that the strap of the backpack doesn't actually fit on the pockets. I found it on the bottom  right side of the pack. It's really nice and tight. If it wasn't tight, that would be a major issue with it, which is why we've added that. The only downside to that is that the strap is still a little wide. The other thing that is really cool about this is that you can add the back cover to the backpack even if the cover is just a little wider.

But at the same time, there are still some issues that you will still find at the sides of the backpack. This is because the straps are different from what you're used to on a pack. In most cases it's just going to just hang in place.

The pocket of the backpack is actually just what I've come to expect from this pack. The front part of the pocket is not just the straps but is also the straps. That is an option we just put them on but you can definitely customize your own for it.

It also seems to have a little less of a drawstring than the X version and the backpack, so if you want to hang it up, you could probably put on your old bandage and put it on your new backpack. That will make it more durable.
