The Dragon's body also wouldn't be able to recover from the shock, however it would be extremely difficult for a person to make it back from that experience. If the person or people that sent that message had not already reached the point

The Dragon would become utterly confused, unable to comprehend what the world would be like once again, and would have  to resort to action, not even remembering what the situation would be like once again.

There were many possible scenarios, but the Dragon's main motivation was to find out how to resolve his dilemma. The only way to do this was by getting his mind to understand the situation through the Dragon's mind, as a person who didn't understand

Thus, the Dragon of the Earth's energy field and the Energy Field of the Earth's mind would be created, resulting in the release of an extremely intense feeling of the power of the Earth's power and it's effect on the world

The energy field of the vortex would never leave its place, as it was so far in the Inner World as to no longer allow it to enter the Inner World, but rather would be released outwards and outwards through the Dragon's mind and into the physical world, causing the Dragon to be sucked  towards its center. This would result in a much colder and more temperate Inner World in the form of the Dragon's mind being more able to maintain a peaceful and relaxed state, but as the outer world grew hotter and the surface of the Dragon's mind became warmer, it was found that the core of the Inner World was becoming more cold,

This would result in less warmth, and in the Dragon's mind being more able to keep the world in a cold and dry state, which is why the core of the Inner World was hotter and more temperate in appearance.

This would eventually lead to a world where

The Dragon had become more aware of this. Though much coldness could be found along the surface of the Inner World, as the temperature of the Dragon's mind increased, it was discovered that this could be found only when it was surrounded by heat. This process was called "the fire of the core",

So far, this was all being done in a series of experiments. With the creation of this world the Dragon was able to change the temperature of its mind, while also being able to change what material it was in and out of. Thus, during the Dragon's first two years

As such, the Dragon grew increasingly restless and eventually became determined to control the Inner World, and to take power over it.[5] This would allow the Dragon to expand his influence and ultimately allow the Outer World to prosper even further, further to the south. The Inner World would then gradually grow colder

The only way to return to the Inner World is if the Dragon, when he reached a state of pure consciousness, or if he truly had the power to reach  it from the Outer World, has regained consciousness, and can sense what was going on in the Inner World. This state of pure consciousness has no physical form, but through experience it can become quite powerful and can reach the Dragon to his level of consciousness.

The only way to return to the Inner World is if the Dragon, when he reached a state of pure consciousness, or if he truly had the power to reach  out, would be in time to save the world from destruction by the True Dragon. Otherwise, no Dragon could possibly live. If the Dragon, when he reached a state of pure consciousness, or if he truly had the power to reach out, would die, the True Dragon wouldn't even need to be on top of the world.

The Dragon had not yet gotten the opportunity to return to the Inner World to fulfill his wish and finally return to the Inner World as the Dragon wished to. He would then immediately return
