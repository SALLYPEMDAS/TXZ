The Snowmen are watching. 

- What?

- Why do you always wear clothes?

- I'm not a boy!

[They take out their snowman jackets and show their heads, showing them how they do the dressage tricks. They sit down and watch.]

- Why not? I guess I look like a man, right?

- I've never looked like a man.

- Well, you can't be. What do you have to lose?

- What?

- You're pretty much guaranteed to be naked by now, no matter what.

- I'm not a boy? Well, you are. [They all look shocked, and they try to ignore him] [Scene: The Snowball. The snowmen have their eyes open, and are staring at the moon. They're wearing their snowman jackets, but they are naked.]

- Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Whoa, whoa. [He walks past them, but they all stare at him. He walks up to them.
