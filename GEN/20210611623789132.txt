They (the French)  have come up with an interesting theory about the cause and effect of the natural climate. A paper in Nature Geoscience found that climate has a lot to do with the rate of cooling. The scientists found that a reduction in ocean temperatures would affect the rate of warming. That's called the "super-caused cooling" hypothesis, which explains why some researchers think humans and

When I told scientists what they were trying to do, they said, "Okay, that's good. Let's go ahead and see how you do it." We used to look at global warming as a whole. The question is, where does that fit into the picture of human activity or natural climate change? It's not necessarily
