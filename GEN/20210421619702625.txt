In July, Russia reported its biggest ever financial crisis, and the country's new president Vladimir Putin said last week that Russia was facing the biggest economic  crisis since World War Two.

Earlier in June, the IMF said that Russia's economy was "severely negative", even as it cut its oil imports, and that many people saw signs of increased unemployment.

Russia is one of only a handful of developed countries that have not experienced severe oil shortages, which were exacerbated after its default

Monsanto's proposed change to the existing rules means a big reduction in the number of plant workers and equipment in a state where most of the jobs could be lost .

The study found no change in the number of plant workers across the state. The average for states with a population of 1.5 million or more was about 50.

And a study that looked at the effect of changes in the rules on the costs of food-related chemicals found that changes in the rules would "have no

Monsanto's proposed change to the existing rules means a big reduction in the number of plant workers and equipment in a state where most of the jobs could be lost  by the new rule. But the proposal would leave workers without any jobs for almost a decade, and could have far greater repercussions than current rule changes.

Last year, more than 150,000 plant workers died in the U.S. from illnesses caused by pesticides known as "methane bombs," or PMs. There are now

It will be up to the regulator to decide whether to continue the rule.

The government argues that these changes do not protect workers or their families. The company believes that in an age when more than 50 per cent of the 1.7 billion people in the United States work in the mining industry, this would be bad news for the jobs.

The energy crisis is the latest blow to China's economic leadership, the biggest on record. The nation was hit by a dramatic energy market meltdown last September, during  which it lost power to nearly two thirds of its population. The government had planned to use a 50 per cent subsidy for wind and solar, but the subsidies were in effect for a 20 per cent subsidy for electricity supplied by private companies, and a 25 per cent subsidy for coal.

The plan was made, the report said, because China

The energy crisis is the latest blow to China's economic leadership, the biggest on record. The nation was hit by a dramatic energy market meltdown last September, during  which it lost more than a quarter of its coal reserves.

It is also home to China's biggest hydroelectric plant, which is now operating at half its capacity.

The country's economy had slumped to its weakest point since its early-90s recovery in the early 2000s. However, China's GDP grew 7.3

The energy crisis is the latest blow to China's economic leadership, the biggest on record. The nation was hit by a dramatic energy market meltdown last September, during  which it fell back to the "lost decade" status it had been known for decades.

The Chinese economy grew 8.7 percent in the fourth quarter of this year, compared with a 3.7 percent growth for the same period a year earlier. That's the first time since the financial crisis that the country experienced the slowdown.

The energy crisis is the latest blow to China's economic leadership, the biggest on record. The nation was hit by a dramatic energy market meltdown last September, during  which coal-fired power plants burned the equivalent of 6 billion barrels of coal per day.

The global price of coal was hit hard by the global financial crisis and its effect on China. This year, in June, the China Energy Research Institute issued a report estimating the cost of producing 4 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalent at the end of

"It is possible that it could create a dangerous fusion power system and lead to some form of nuclear war. This is because there is much uncertainty about whether it can be delivered safely,"  said Richard O'Boyle, a professor of nuclear economics at the University of Sheffield.

"The biggest worry is that the new generation of reactors may produce excess power if one of these reactors fails to meet its target in the future."

In the past, the number of nuclear power plants had surged. One such reactor in Australia
