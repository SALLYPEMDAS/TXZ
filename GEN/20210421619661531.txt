It's her. 

T.D.: She had no idea what I was talking about.

T.D.: She's like, "Why aren't you  with me?" and I'm like, "You're trying to get to know me a little bit, but we're not talking that much."

A.M.: Like, the thing that you didn't know was this little thing was happening in your family. You were just being used by these people. But now she's being used

T.D.: She's like, "Why aren't you  talking to me, mother?" Because I was a victim, too.

T.D.: She's like, "Why aren't you  out and about the place? They say they know you're not being kind to them." So I was like, "Oh, but if she doesn't like it, then I'll get hurt."

A.M.: It's funny because they had no idea. Because it's her story. It's her story for sure.

It's her.  She's right. What happened? Why did you just leave her here?"
