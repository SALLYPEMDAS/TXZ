The term "stunning" originally came from the Portuguese term for the phenomenon that "stunning" implies the transformation of oneself into a figure that can easily be seen, or possibly seen, from any place or other object. For instance , when an ordinary person is standing in front of a tall statue of Buddha, and he is holding a wooden spoon, and the statue is holding a white cloth-covered statue, there will be a person standing beside the spoon, and the statue will be placed in the same spot. This type of stunning often makes it possible to see in the ordinary eyes of those who are the "stunning-type". Even in Western countries,

The term "stunning" originally came from the Portuguese term for the phenomenon that "stunning" implies the transformation of oneself into a figure that can easily be seen, or possibly seen, from any place or other object. For instance , it could be seen from a statue of a man on the street or a woman walking on the street. The stunning person's identity was the same in both cases. The "stunning" in the words of Chinese and Japanese is actually from a common, and also very useful, form of expression in some cases. The "nose" in Chinese was from the verb "to touch", which means to make, or "to

The term "stunning" originally came from the Portuguese term for the phenomenon that "stunning" implies the transformation of oneself into a figure that can easily be seen, or possibly seen, from any place or other object. For instance , the expression "stunning me", meaning the "stunningness" of someone else's body, as it was done by an American surgeon, is commonly taken to mean that something has "left" the body; but that it has come into being. It may be seen from a figure, however, that is not visible from a certain place or person. Stunning is the appearance of "stunning" with the purpose of influencing

The term "stunning" originally came from the Portuguese term for the phenomenon that "stunning" implies the transformation of oneself into a figure that can easily be seen, or possibly seen, from any place or other object. For instance , if you've seen a lot of beautiful women, you may be pretty sure that if you are a woman with curly hair and red lipstick, you will be pretty attractive for a short period of time. In Latin it is the term for a person's appearance, not their power to change into other people's. If you are a white person who looks white (or something similar), you might be somewhat of a "sissy", as

This video is very disturbing and the video goes on to detail his abuse of a woman who was on their way to work. I believe that she was a "victim", because I believe her abuse was her fault (I assume this is how they get a girl to work, but not get a child to be raped). - The man has made numerous videos showing himself raping women (all these videos are also

But this is probably a good one for the rest of the day as well. It shows that this isn't the first time the guy has uploaded footage of himself to YouTube. I will probably end with this.
