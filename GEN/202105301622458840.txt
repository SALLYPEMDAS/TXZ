The Space Crusade

The Space Crusade  had a large share of the Imperium, but that group, of which there were a few hundred, was considered a mere third of the Imperium, and that group had been largely ignored by the Imperium over the centuries. That would change once their leadership had been taken over by the new Emperor, and there was, obviously, a very high level of animosity against the Space Marines in those days.

After a few years of combat, and having been able to hold a small amount of power for a long time, the Imperium had, however, given in to an increasing pressure on the Space Marines. After the battle of Gorgon in 24 ABY, there were rumors of a massive alien invasion that resulted in the Space Marines' death. It was assumed the Imperium would never admit a mistake, but when they did, they were unable to defend themselves, and were subsequently forced to retreat to their own homeworld. Eventually, the Space Marines were allowed to make one last stand against the aliens, but by then, most of the Imperium had completely lost faith in them.

In 4 ABY, after a long, protracted battle for the northern part of the galaxy, the Imperium were finally able to defeat the alien forces within the confines of the Gorg

In 4 ABY, after a long, protracted battle for the northern part of the galaxy, the Imperium were finally able to defeat the alien forces within the confines of the Gorg on Nebula. The Imperium were no longer the world's largest, and the very notion of a massive invasion was no longer considered a reasonable one, since no one, in the Imperium, had ever been able to force the xenos into Earth as a matter of course. The Imperium were so thoroughly disgusted by the xenos invasion that they decided to begin a war with the galaxy's oldest race, the Space Marines.

However, before the Emperor could decide whether he was ready to make a final judgement, however, a large number of aliens had formed in the northern reaches of the galaxy. They were called the Xibalistic (known to some as the Xibalic Plague), and the very sight of a massive xenos army from the galaxy's core had put an end to almost all of the xenos that had been fighting for them. These alien threats led the Imperial authorities to take an extremely active role in the development of the Space Marines' Space Marine Legions, and in a short time they were able to lead a series of events that had drastically changed the course of the Imperium. The Emperor's decision to withdraw was taken in secret, though this was only mentioned during the First Council of the Council of Stellaris.
