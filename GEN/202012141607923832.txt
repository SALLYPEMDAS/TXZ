"The three men I was interviewing were in the midst of their careers when the fire  happened. A lot of them were still young, so they are very familiar with the city and what they were doing. It just goes to show you how much respect those men gave to each other. The work went well and they were just as dedicated to their respective communities and that's what made them want to become firefighters."

"This man did not just start out looking for a job," said a local source familiar with the encounter. "

"It was a very large, highly decorated and well-known member of the New York City Fire and Police Department. The men were very well trained and knew the fire apparatus and the techniques to make their vehicles safe and secure.

"The three men I was interviewing were in the midst of their careers when the fire  first started, and the other three have a long record of fighting for their families. They did not lose their lives and were not harmed. They were well-equipped for this mission, and there were many other members of the department who were involved in that. The fire was a blessing."

Rising crime rates are in many ways a function of the increasing crime of firearms. More gun-related crime than in any other time in New York

"The three men I was interviewing were in the midst of their careers when the fire  arrived. One of them was a military officer who had been in the United States for some years and had retired in 2008.

"I remember that he said he came in after he had put his name on the fire and was about to leave for Japan when he saw the men coming in and the fire started.

"That's when I said, 'What is it you're looking for?' The three men were all just walking around

"The three men I was interviewing were in the midst of their careers when the fire  happened, they are a very important part of our organization and I think we were really impressed with all of them."

Mills said the two officers were very professional in their training and they were not just good at training, they were really good at maintaining order and discipline.

But what impressed Mills was not just that they were able to take control of the fire, but that they could do it in a timely manner.

"I don't know how to use the word 'familiarize.'"<|endoftext|>MICHIGAN (Reuters) - Mongolian troops will be on the frontline with militants from Islamic State in a major offensive to recapture the capital, an ethnic Han majority leader said on Sunday, sparking fears that the movement was on the brink of a massive offensive. 

In an interview with Reuters from an undisclosed location in the city of Taman, a source close to Mongolian Foreign Minister Tan Sri Teng-i-peng, who met a military commander outside the governorate, urged the fighters to make the fight their last and last.

"They need to fight for their culture and their history and also for their religion," the source told Reuters.

"The enemy will be on the back foot in the long run," Gubov said after a military operation near the city of Turkana in Mongolia's Yalta region on a small hill, which he said was strategically located between Turkana and Kharassai.

"They will not lose. It is not an easy road," he told Reuters.

The move would put pressure on the country's central government - which has struggled to keep a steady grip on its vast territory - to end the fighting that erupted during the March 20 revolution that toppled a central government which was led by a former Mongolian nationalist who calls himself the "Mongolian Republic".

"They're on the front line. We have a serious threat and the whole country knows it," Mongolian provincial president A

The U.S.-led military coalition, which has been conducting major combat missions across the country, says it is seeking "all possible means to bring the fighting to an end" and is building a force to take control of the capital, which lies about 1,500km (300 miles) from the capital's main hub, Mariupol.

An estimated 1,500 soldiers have been drafted into the army, and 1,
