Upgrade  that includes all of your items in each player's inventory:

The more you have in your inventory the more items will go out of your control.

Players can change what gear they have (and how to use them) on the fly.

The easier it is to obtain and the more players who can buy items through the Crafting, Crafting & Repair system, the more players will start having fun and get the same loot.

Some of the items in this list are also good to keep for yourself if you're looking for other mods that can add some other interesting bonuses.

A White House official said the administration is still considering whether to pursue the offer to the White House. But when asked about the issue in an interview with ABC News' Michael Byers, one senior Trump official said the administration might want to revisit the offer in some form.

"We're taking it seriously," the official said. "We just have to wait and see how things evolve and how it's developed for our federal workforce."

The White House has been mulling a similar offer to employers across the country, with some companies in Florida and elsewhere suggesting they might consider a similar proposal.

Trump was in Washington this week to give a speech in support of the White House's plan. He said  the government's policymaking should focus on the economy rather than focusing on the individual states and cities.

"We're going to get out there, we're going to make it easy for the American people to access their health care," Trump said. "That's going to be better for everybody, and that's what we're going to do."

[It's not just Obamacare that Trump has threatened to take over. It is also the Affordable Care Act and other efforts at helping people and reducing their costs.]

White House officials told ABC News the offer is not being tied to specific legislation, and the plan doesn't involve federal money.

"The idea was to get some help from the federal government," said a White House official. "This is just something we're trying to make our own decisions."

The White House also is working on plans for more federal money to support low- and middle-income workers, but the plan won't make any progress at this point. Trump has said many jobs in his administration would require higher wages or higher benefits, and Trump has also repeatedly threatened to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.

"What he has offered is a proposal that is going to take these workers away, and they will take it out of the United States. We'll make them go on to other jobs, and they will go on to more jobs," said a White House official.

And for some jobs at least, the idea of hiring people from another country won't get any easier.

The White House announced on Wednesday that it was considering a series of steps that would have a ripple effect on the American economy as companies close, creating more jobs and adding new ones in more locations.

In August, President Trump and his transition team released a set of steps to ease the pressure on businesses. The White House announced the number of jobs they had created and how many were part of a new payroll plan.
