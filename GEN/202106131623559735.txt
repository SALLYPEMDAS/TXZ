I'm watching you.  He's going to be a long, happy man."

The man replied with a grin.

"We don't need to talk," the man's reply said.

Hands met, as if to reveal a secret.

"If you want to talk about it," the woman replied with a smile.

"It's just an inconvenience," the man's response said.

"The man's wife, too, knows about this," said the woman.

"My husband has been in a relationship with her for a couple of months," said the man's reply.

"Can I see what you said in an interview?" the woman asked.

"Yes, I have a question, but you cannot say it without my permission. I'm sure you understand that, my lady," the man's reply said.

"Are you sure you can get your wife to leave you," said the woman.

"Well, it's a good question, I suppose," the man's reply said.

"I know what you mean," said the woman.

"I'm sure you will," said the man's reply.

It was the moment that most people expected to be interrupted.

There was no longer any reason for the man to give his reply, just as he was leaving, his wife was waiting for him. The man waited for her to answer, for she stood before him, waiting for him to answer. But he kept his mouth shut

Then the woman looked at the man.

"I saw that he had an offer in the bank for this beautiful young man," the woman said.

"It's a small, but not insignificant offer," the man said.

"Oh, I see," the woman said.

"This is not something that you want in your life," the man replied.

The woman looked back at him. "No, I mean, there's no need," she said.

"Then you do not think it's a big deal?"

"I don't know," the woman replied.

The man walked over to the woman and, standing there with his left hand, asked, "What do you want?"

"I asked the bank to make some money, you know. But, just because I want it, it's impossible. This is not your fault!" The woman replied.
