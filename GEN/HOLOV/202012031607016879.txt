The only people you will ever find who are not on the wrong side of history will be those who will be your heroes.

That was the point of my "The Big  Short" interview with John Scalzi when he said "it was important to stop talking about things like racism". We are not talking about things like the Black Lives Matter movement or the Black

The only people you will ever find who are not on the wrong side of history will be those who will be your heroes.

That was the point of my "The Big  Deal" podcast, and now there's something else. There's a new book coming out called "The Big Deal: How Your Enemies Will Think You're The Worst and how your friends

The only people you will ever find who are not on the wrong side of history will be those who will be your heroes.

That was the point of my "The Big  Picture" report. I've made clear that I disagree with any of these pundits. But, we can continue to be a country of immigrants and those of good will for the undocumented.

The only people you will ever find who are not on the wrong side of history will be those who will be your heroes.

That was the point of my "The Big  Picture" post. That's why I'm so pleased with what we've done and why it's come to this.

The only people you will ever find who are not on the wrong side of history will be those who will be your heroes.

That was the point of my "The Big gest Crisis" blog post. The first was that it didn't quite take off in the big way. I'd been looking forward to the book for almost 15 years, and was actually

The only people you will ever find who are not on the wrong side of history will be those who will be your heroes.

That was the point of my "The Big  Lebowski" column a couple of months ago, as an example of how I think the "real American" should feel when being oppressed by the rest of the country.

The only people you will ever find who are not on the wrong side of history will be those who will be your heroes.

That was the point of my "The Big  Three", my original list of top 10 books of all time, and I'm just getting started now.

So with that in mind, I figured I'd provide an explanation of

The only people you will ever find who are not on the wrong side of history will be those who will be your heroes.

That was the point of my "The Big  Picture" piece. But the point of this piece is not to argue a particular group (those on the wrong side of history) can't be heroes, but rather that when you put
