The original concept of the N.W.A.'s first song was, by the way, "I Am Your Enemy." This song, by the way, is a very different song,  but you'll find that if you listen to the music, it will just be different. But then the N.W.A. really had this crazy, funny thing happen, which is that they

The original concept of the N.W.A.'s first song was, by the way, "I Am Your Enemy." This song, by the way, is a very different song,  and for some reason it has an odd resonance to the song and it makes for a very interesting piece of lyrics.

The original concept of the N.W.A.'s first song was, by the way, "I Am Your Enemy." This song, by the way, is a very different song,  and it was actually written during the height of this band's popularity. This song, by the way, is a very different song from what you would normally see during a jam session. We were using

The original concept of the N.W.A.'s first song was, by the way, "I Am Your Enemy." This song, by the way, is a very different song,  as it's also a rather different version of the song, written by the man who, I guess, is responsible for the entire song. And as I went back in time, I discovered that this

The original concept of the N.W.A.'s first song was, by the way, "I Am Your Enemy." This song, by the way, is a very different song,  a whole different kind of song.
