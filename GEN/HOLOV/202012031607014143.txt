The original concept of the N.W.A.'s first song was, by the way, "I Am Your Enemy." This song, by the way, is a very different song,  but you'll find that if you listen to the music, it will just be different. But then the N.W.A. really had this crazy, funny thing happen, which is that they

The original concept of the N.W.A.'s first song was, by the way, "I Am Your Enemy." This song, by the way, is a very different song,  and it was actually written during the height of this band's popularity.

The original concept of the N.W.A.'s first song was, by the way, "I Am Your Enemy." This song, by the way, is a very different song,  as it's also a rather different version of the song, written by the man who, I guess, is responsible for the entire song. And as I went back in time, I discovered that this

The original concept of the N.W.A.'s first song was, by the way, "I Am Your Enemy." This song, by the way, is a very different song,  a whole different kind of song.
