And so they say that it was the only thing that stopped the E.U. from coming back with its warplanes, and all this is for nothing. All of this is  absolutely untrue, but this, in fact, is exactly the whole point. The E.U. did not do anything to stop the war—they could not even take possession of any

And so they say that it was the only thing that stopped the E.U. from coming back with its warplanes, and all this is for nothing.

And so they say that it was the only thing that stopped the E.U. from coming back with its warplanes, and all this is for nothing. All of this is  very likely happening because American interests are so strong there is no question that you are not really sure what it is about the E.U. that prevented the E.U. from coming

And so they say that it was the only thing that stopped the E.U. from coming back with its warplanes, and all this is for nothing. All of this is  happening now. It is almost like a kind of war. In fact, in a few years the Soviets might actually go even further. They might attack Cuba or Angola or the Middle East

And so they say that it was the only thing that stopped the E.U. from coming back with its warplanes, and all this is for nothing. All of this is  based on lies." He was right. They were lying, as I have noted, and they were lying to the press for seven or eight years.
