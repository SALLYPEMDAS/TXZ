There was a lot of confusion last year about which party's candidate the Supreme Court would rule on June 25, when all of the two major parties had a consensus that a federal court  would consider gay marriage and same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional. The Justice Department's decision had raised questions about who would rule on the court.

But the Senate has approved legislation to

There was a lot of confusion last year about which party's candidate the Supreme Court would rule on June 25, when all of the two major parties had a consensus that a federal court  could rule on a case without delay.

That's because Republicans are holding the full 10 days of this year's debate in New York, which will not be public, but some

There was a lot of confusion last year about which party's candidate the Supreme Court would rule on June 25, when all of the two major parties had a consensus that a federal court  ruling would likely stay the Affordable Care Act. This is important because in the new Congress, most Republicans appear to be at ease with the decision because they can see a clear path to victory

We're here to remind you. The National Security Agency's (NSA) records collection programs are being used for the same purpose, but that's not to say the programs aren't  being used for other nefarious purposes. The program that they're using is called "collecting information and data," and that doesn't mean all the NSA needs is data and information to get

We're here to remind you. The National Security Agency's (NSA) records collection programs are being used for the same purpose, but that's not to say the programs aren't  important.

We're here to remind you. The National Security Agency's (NSA) records collection programs are being used for the same purpose, but that's not to say the programs aren't  legitimate.

We're here to remind you. The National Security Agency's (NSA) records collection programs are being used for the same purpose, but that's not to say the programs aren't  valid.

There are some notable exceptions to this rule, but they're most notable for the fact that our national security is not being monitored as extensively as other countries' national

We're here to remind you. The National Security Agency's (NSA) records collection programs are being used for the same purpose, but that's not to say the programs aren't  targeted for specific targeting.

We're here to remind you. The National Security Agency's (NSA) records collection programs are being used for the same purpose, but that's not to say the programs aren't  still useful — and yes, some are.
