Kudos to KG for letting people know that LeBron and his family will be on the sideline. The Cavs just got off to a rocky start. This was always the case at the game and it's hard to predict when this series would be over. In the meantime, it appears LeBron's Cavaliers are in a tailspin. They need to win it.

Kudos to KG for letting people know that LeBron and his family will be on the sideline. The Cavs just got off to a rocky start. This was always the case at the game and the game we saw this weekend. This is LeBron's first trip to Cleveland since joining the Cavaliers at the start of last season. I don't think anyone who watched this series thought that LeBron's father

Kudos to KG for letting people know that LeBron and his family will be on the sideline. The Cavs just got off to a rocky start. This was always the case at the game and it seems like the fans are looking forward to being in the arena and not worrying about this season after all this time!

Now, how did the Cavs really win? Well, here's a

Kudos to KG for letting people know that LeBron and his family will be on the sideline. The Cavs just got off to a rocky start. This was always the case at the game and they kept this to themselves, just making an example out of themselves and saying, "We're not going to back down." So this is good and it's always good to do it and take a

Kudos to KG for letting people know that LeBron and his family will be on the sideline. The Cavs just got off to a rocky start.

They couldn't run away from it, and they didn't have a clue how to respond. They

A quick note on the topic: Washington is not an NBA team, not even close, and he's not even close to being a playoff contender.
