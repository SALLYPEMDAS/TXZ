"If it wasn't for these three factors we might have been stuck in a different situation," Riggs said.

In her view, some of the other factors included her involvement in an effort to fight the federal program that provides food stamps to people with pre-existing health conditions, her mother's involvement with that effort, and the fact that she was paid at her home and in other

"If it wasn't for these three factors we might have been stuck in a different situation," Riggs said.

In her view, some of the other factors included her involvement in an earlier round of negotiations with the Nationals, the fact she was a "top priority for everyone from the front office to the general manager," and the recent news she received that she'd be returning home from

"If it wasn't for these three factors we might have been stuck in a different situation," Riggs said.
