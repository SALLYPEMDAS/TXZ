The Irving deal was first reported by ESPN.com.

The Cavaliers have no choice but to buy out LeBron James. It could cost them at least $18 million per year and could cost the Cavs dearly in the long run.

Of course, the real reason to bring Irving to Cleveland is to keep the team. He is arguably better than any other player on the planet and is still worth a lot more than he would have earned at any other time.

The big difference is that, unlike some of the other superstar superstars of

The Irving deal was first reported by ESPN.com.

The Cavaliers have no choice. This is the first team in the NBA since 2010 to acquire another All-Star and two All-Star teams. There will be some competition for the first two rings.

"This deal is a significant step toward a more open league," said Mike Dunleavy, ESPN Sports Entertainment Group general manager. "The league has to put its money where its mouth is and make sure it has the tools it needs to grow. The owners have a good stake

The Irving deal was first reported by ESPN.com.

The Cavaliers have no choice but to make this deal contingent on their owner paying the remaining $50 million in luxury tax to help cover what he had to pay under the agreement. The value of that luxury tax, as of yet, remains undisclosed. Irving will likely receive $30 million per year to support the luxury tax payments from the Cavaliers. That would give Irving some flexibility to find a buyer as the new deal begins to get made. The Cavs could also consider paying Irving's market value to

The Irving deal was first reported by ESPN.com.

The Cavaliers have no choice but to pay out $75 million in player salaries to bring Irving back in 2018.

"It's good for us to be able to bring in a guy to take over our guys," Cavaliers president of basketball operations and general manager Rob Hennigan said. "He's one of the best players in the game right now and he's an amazing talent who deserves to continue to come here and contribute and compete on a great level."

The Irving deal was first reported by ESPN.com.

The Cavaliers have no choice but to be in an extremely attractive spot to sign Irving, according to sources. Irving is averaging 15.2 points, 5.9 rebounds and 3.6 assists, which are all in the top 10 among all NBA point guards.

The new deal with the Miami Heat will be a one-time, multi-year contract worth up to $25 million and comes with an automatic buyout clause. This deal is scheduled to expire when LeBron James leaves the

The Cavaliers have no choice but to continue with what they have at center and guard, especially with Kyrie Irving's departure. The Cavs have been trying to retain Irving as much as possible for years, but his departure was a surprise to many.

In an interview with Sports Illustrated after the news broke, LeBron James said he felt he had been able to do more in his career than he had at any point this season.

The Cavaliers have no choice but to re-sign Irving because they can't afford to pay the salary cap and, therefore, no interest in letting him stay.

He was back in the lineup for the Bulls, and he scored two points in the game-clinching win.

The Bulls would have been without their star, but that will not be the case. They had to find a way to get him on the floor.

There was talk of the Bulls needing to bring their star back from Cleveland. There was also talk about whether or not Irving should be back in Cleveland. Even though he has a lot of shooting, Irving can't be seen as a point guard at this point. He's a 3-point shooter, but he's just so slow

He was back in the lineup for the Bulls, and he scored two points in the game-clinching win.

The Bulls would have been able to keep their star, Irving, if it weren't for LeBron James. The Cavaliers, meanwhile, were down to three points and just six minutes from the game, and they ended up taking the lead in overtime with 14 seconds left. Irving was a monster, and he gave the Bulls a 14-point lead to go with a dunk. The game was close, but not as close as many might have thought.

The Bulls would have been on the verge of a blowout win if that happened, but as much as we loved Irving's shooting, he was also just one of four Bulls on the roster that was on the court for the Finals. They are no longer a contender but one of several who have been here since the time they had Irving.

The Bulls would have been outscored by 22 to 19 in the title game if Irving hadn't missed two straight minutes of action. The Bulls were on the verge of clinching the East after LeBron James was in New York to win the NBA title with his team. Irving didn't play well at the end of the first quarter against the Knicks, but his minutes helped the Bulls rebound. The only reason the Bulls weren't outscored was that Irving's effort was blocked.

The Bulls would have been able to have their own superstar this season, as they have done with the likes of J.R. Smith and Mike Dunleavy, and LeBron James has been on the court the entire season for this reason alone. He was very much the primary reason for this team's success in 2016-17, and the Bulls have always been a strong team behind their star.

So what do you think?

The Bulls would have been able to get some of their games back, but they were outscored 25-8, and as such it would've been a great loss. Irving has been playing like that since his rookie year, so the game will get off to a great start. It could happen again, and it will.

LOS ANGELES (AP) — If you're one of the NBA's better teams without Tim Duncan, you've got one thing to look forward to. And a little while back, his mother called it quits, saying he would need to get a family doctor to check in on him.

The league agreed to a trade in 2012 for his services and now Duncan could be back on the court, if the Heat can't beat the Knicks or Spurs for an NBA title. But his mom is a bit worried.

"I feel like we've been betrayed," mother Karen told WNBA TV's Chad Ford on Thursday. "When we look back on things like Tim being out of work, we've said we're going to keep Tim at home and try to get him through the summer and help him take full advantage of what it is that we

The league agreed to a trade in 2012 for his services and now Duncan could be back on the floor Thursday when the Los Angeles Clippers host the Orlando Magic in an Eastern Conference Semifinals.

Now, it's Duncan's turn. The 29-year-old shot 10.3 percent at Indiana State University this year, including 2-of-3 from three, and is averaging 25.5 points over his past four games.

The league agreed to a trade in 2012 for his services and now Duncan could be back on the court in 2013 to replace Duncan's broken foot.

Now in his mid-thirties, the NBA has agreed to trade Duncan to a Brooklyn team that would match his age. A source told ESPN that Duncan would need a team physician to check in with the league team and if the deal did not go through, he'd have to make a return to the NBA.

The league agreed to a trade in 2012 for his services and now Duncan could be back on the court as soon as the end of the season. The former first-round pick is scheduled to appear on CBS's "Sunday Night Football" Saturday night at 1 p.m. ET on NFL Network. He was previously a two-time first-round pick (2009, 2008) and one-time first-round pick (2009, 2010).

The league agreed to a trade in 2012 for his services and now Duncan could be back on the court with a vengeance. But he has been unable to play, and his mother, who has dementia, has to live off him.

"I'm not going to move," she said Thursday after watching Duncan get in trouble on the court with the Grizzlies in the Western Conference finals. "But this time the game is the best I can imagine, so I'm happy. If I don't play, I don't want to play."

The Clippers are coming off a losing streak. The Mavericks have lost two in a row, the Spurs are going 5-9. The Clippers need Duncan to make them a healthy scratch. If they want to keep him, they'll have to find ways to get him back from a back injury, a trade or trade away.

The league agreed to a trade in 2012 for his services and now Duncan could be back on the court. He was expected to be back to full power by 2017.

But after playing four years with the Lakers, Duncan's season was derailed by knee injuries. The league is not allowing him to play for much longer. He will be back this summer and then he will leave on a season-long contract.

Duncan had a career high 17 points in a 109-89 win over the Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday. He was averaging 25.

The league agreed to a trade in 2012 for his services and now Duncan could be back on the road soon, after a bad start.

"I want Tim out there every day," Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said this week. "He's got a new job, he's got a new family. And that's his job."

The Los Angeles Clippers are currently in the middle of a rebuild of sorts. The Clippers traded Duncan to Dallas in exchange for a $9 million max deal and their coach, Doc Rivers, was asked last week

There are two other things that could make up for the loss of Irving. The second is that the Warriors would like to do much worse than play on a bad offensive team, which would be a problem for the Clippers. That's not an easy problem to solve. The Clippers were a playoff team in 2011, and their recent dominance was an embarrassment, not to mention the fact that their defense was terrible last season. The Clippers are now trying to rebuild around their future Hall of Famer, and Irving's future is in question. It's impossible to have two teams in a position that want their best player on the floor and one team that wants him on the bench.

There are two other things that could make up for the loss of Irving. The second is that the Warriors would like to do much worse than play on a bad offensive team, which would be a problem for them.

So, it looks like the Warriors will be spending more on three-and-D if they need to. Even with a max-salary exception that could have made any roster move more palatable, there's little doubt that the team still has to decide how it will spend the $6.5 million cap exception — though, even without that, it's probably best to not think about the team's own budget because it might be better

There are two other things that could make up for the loss of Irving. The second is that the Warriors would like to do much worse than play on a bad offensive team, which would be a problem for the Warriors. This will also mean that the team that has lost the past two playoff games, Golden State and the Thunder, is now less than ready to try to replicate the success they had in their previous six or seven games in that situation.

The first thing to watch for in the Warriors' two next-round matchups is how much a big man like Kyrie Irving will make up for a small guy like Irving.

But, again, there's a point, because if the Warriors don't get back to winning ways by the end of the season, it might not be too hard to think that they'd be very, very lucky to play the same kind of team again.

If the Warriors do have a second-line center, that will make up for their bad shooting by starting center Jaylen Brown. When I said Brown is awful in the league, I meant that the Warriors would not be in the playoffs. So the fact that they're getting a second-line center means they have little else to replace him at the position.

So if we're talking about the Warriors, they could make one or two

That's not exactly a good sign if the Warriors don't have to run the ball well on offense (and especially if a team is capable of playing on a good defensive team), but a team like the Sixers could be a lot better if they play better defense, which they are not.

In any case, the NBA salary cap will go up this season by $11.9 million. The new salary cap will go up by $9.

I didn't know Irving was a coach.

But I did know he wasn't a player.

After a long summer in Boston, he was the captain of the Red Wings. (He was later replaced by Craig Berube.) So when he was on the bench, he was still an ambassador for the team.

I didn't know Irving was a coach.

But I did know he wasn't a player.

After a long summer in Boston, he was the captain of the Red Wings. (He was later replaced by Craig Berube.) So when he was on the bench, he was still an ambassador for the team.

It wasn't until a few years ago he was in the middle of his second stint as head coach of the Tampa Bay Lightning. He took over the power play, which was the team's No. 2 unit, from Joe Sakic, who was gone before the lockout, and left the team to help with their power play.

And, as he told the reporters that summer, a lot of things were on his mind.

"This season, I think, with all those things that have gone on since then … it's probably a good thing for me to continue

It wasn't until a few years ago he was in the middle of his second stint as head coach of the Tampa Bay Lightning. So he came up in the midst of that chaos.

He became known in the locker room for his team's success and his willingness to take a gamble with the organization.

"You have to look at it," said St. Louis Blues General Manager Doug Armstrong during a press conference for his third-round pick in 2013. "To me, as a player, the first step in that process is to really evaluate what you need to do

It wasn't until a few years ago he was in the middle of his second stint as head coach of the Tampa Bay Lightning. The previous season, he and Steve Yzerman met at Red Wings games for a chat. At the end of the night, Yzerman recalled the conversation. "He said he'd like to talk to us," Yzerman said. "He said he wanted to talk to us, and we said, 'Well, it seems like we can talk.' And he said, 'Oh, we don't need to talk.'

It wasn't until a few years ago he was in the middle of his second stint as head coach of the Tampa Bay Lightning, where he's currently trying to put it all together for his seventh season in charge.

(He's also a veteran.)

And, he added, "I know we have to be strong. I know we have to be a good team."

Of course, it's no easy task. There's no doubting that. But, at every step, you need to have confidence in yourself.

That's why, when

It wasn't until a few years ago he was in the middle of his second stint as head coach of the Tampa Bay Lightning. He had to come back to New York, and he never stopped.

But Irving left his wife, Lisa, a little more than a year later, and had to move back to the Dominican Republic, where he still lives with her now, her mother's former college hockey coach, and they had kids, along with two siblings. And they never left.

It wasn't until a few years ago he was in the middle of his second stint as head coach of the Tampa Bay Lightning, and he was looking to rekindle his days as the Lightning's star forward.

He met his wife, Kristine, at the T-Mobile Center and, when she took the lead role for a day with him, he watched them take the court together.

"That was my first encounter with her," Irving says of Kristine. "She was a wonderful girl. I just thought, 'It must be good to see something

It wasn't until a few years ago he was in the middle of his second stint as head coach of the Tampa Bay Lightning, when he got out of a suspension.

And then it happened.

He had his first season in Boston. The new coach went out and got some young prospects.

That summer, he brought in young, old and inexperienced players.

They did everything on the ice.

He worked out for a couple of them, and then he went for a quick, physical workout and took a few days off to rest.

It wasn't until a few years ago he was in the middle of his second stint as head coach of the Tampa Bay Lightning, a situation that finally sealed him for years to come. His first stint in the role was with the San Jose Sharks. He went on to take over the New York Rangers and Rangers of the Eastern Conference from the Islanders in 2005.

After six seasons with the Lightning, he was hired by the Minnesota Wild to replace the legendary Jim Rutherford. He worked the first five years of his Lightning tenure as a head coach with the Wild but was fired in June

A couple of years ago, Barkley was asked about how it would feel to play in the New York Knicks' big room, where all the other NBA players have been, before being introduced to all the New York Knicks fans who might have been waiting in the stands and waiting outside the doors at the end of the day.

"I'm gonna play for you, and if you want to do it in New York, if you want to play in New York, and if you're happy to be here in New York, I'll tell you what I love about your time in New York," Barkley said. "And if you want

A couple of years ago, Barkley was asked about how it would feel to play in the New York Knicks' big room, where all the other NBA players have been, before getting in.

Barkley: "I can't think of any basketball team that would do that to me now. I'd just have to get used to it."

So, how did you develop the ability to be that coach that Barkley had?

"He would call up [Barkley] and he would say, 'I think I've got a good shot here.'"

How would that apply to you? How was

A couple of years ago, Barkley was asked about how it would feel to play in the New York Knicks' big room, where all the other NBA players have been, before the NBA draft comes up on Jan. 1. Barkley explained that he's "always been like that" and that it's hard to stay away from playing in the bigger room. And, while he did seem a little confused at first about who was going to be the team's center and center-left wing and who was going to play center, the way he played the game didn't make anyone feel too bad, in and of itself.

A couple of years ago, Barkley was asked about how it would feel to play in the New York Knicks' big room, where all the other NBA players have been, before he became a national phenomenon, that the Bulls might be in a similar situation. And, as you can see from the way this happens, he seemed to believe it.

A couple of years ago, Barkley was asked about how it would feel to play in the New York Knicks' big room, where all the other NBA players have been, before he went on to become a billionaire and become a world-renowned player.

"That was my first big room," Barkley said. "I could tell you. That was my first big room at the University of Connecticut. It's not all that crazy, is it? But it's always a bit crazy and you gotta go there."

He also got some tough questions for a few more questions.

A couple of years ago, Barkley was asked about how it would feel to play in the New York Knicks' big room, where all the other NBA players have been, before he was offered a job with the New York Knicks. Barkley spoke of the joy of playing in the big-time room and wondered if he would make any sense playing in that big room. And then, after he spoke about the joy of playing in the big room, Barkley decided to take his job away from New York and move on to the NBA. The Knicks gave Barkley a job in the NBA.

And that is one of the reasons why, with

A couple of years ago, Barkley was asked about how it would feel to play in the New York Knicks' big room, where all the other NBA players have been, before he took the court to play for the Cavs, and he gave a slightly different answer.

"Just a little bit," Barkley said. "You take it to a whole new level, a little bit. That's all, and it's been good."

The NBA was at his side.

You may recall the Celtics and Lakers were fighting for the No. 2 pick in last April's draft, and the Lakers weren't happy with their

A couple of years ago, Barkley was asked about how it would feel to play in the New York Knicks' big room, where all the other NBA players have been, before they could even step on the court. And Barkley said the Knicks' biggest problem has been basketball players and how much they want to play there.

He added, "You can't give a star player the ball and just play. You have to give him the ball and try to do the same thing over and over again. I've had the great success of our young guys in the big room, and I think I'm doing a better job on the

This year we've been looking at those long, hard, often conflicting questions. In the summer of 2010, we asked more questions, and this year we've focused on the more often asked questions . The latest question is: How would you describe the relationship between a movie you liked and a friend you liked? A friend is going to call you every time, and that will tell you what kind of relationship you might like and dislike. A friend is going to tell you what kind of movie you like and dislike, and the two of you are going to talk about it.

Of course, it's true that this all comes down to how you perceive

This year we've been looking at those long, hard, often conflicting questions. In the summer of 2010, we asked more questions, and this year we've focused on the more often asked questions . We've begun by making sure we ask these questions when we know you might have any questions to ask. So here's what we've discovered this year, but first, we're adding answers to questions about the movie. For example, to answer "What is the worst thing you've ever seen," we ask "Who was that guy doing that?"

Now that we've looked at some of the more popular questions, we'd like to do more:

This year we've been looking at those long, hard, often conflicting questions. In the summer of 2010, we asked more questions, and this year we've focused on the more often asked questions , with the goal of building on past performance and adding more than just an audience. This is our way of saying "We've seen the future" and building the future from the past is a part of our job as filmmakers.

In 2013, we made our best movie yet and the answer remains in our prayers.

This year we've been looking at those long, hard, often conflicting questions. In the summer of 2010, we asked more questions, and this year we've focused on the more often asked questions . We also looked at the longer question sets, and on the best and worst movies that went back to the beginning. All of these questions are designed to help you find your answer, so they can give you the answers you need. They are a great way to find out if a movie was great, and give you the information you need.

Here are the big-picture questions that I've found most useful this year:

This year we've been looking at those long, hard, often conflicting questions. In the summer of 2010, we asked more questions, and this year we've focused on the more often asked questions . In the fall of 2010, the films we were most interested in were not just the latest ones or the ones that were released by big names; they were in the theaters. So what do we find with these questions? Well, here's some of our ideas.

For us, we found that in the second half of the year, we saw more films that were still on their way to getting made in the first place. We also found that,

We also want to be clear that this survey wasn't an objective survey and not to make any recommendations to specific audiences.

So, when did you get interested in the film industry? How would you rate your own films if you went?

After reading an interview with the director of the documentary, Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Rises, the film-going public asked what their favorite movie was.

Before I begin, I want to go over some of the things that go into your question.

What is the longest question you've ever asked someone?

The answer will vary depending on who asked it and how you answered it. We've found that people most often ask an entire question after just a few short questions.

This book was in 1814 published in the Journal of the American Friends of  the United States and contains many other historical entries from the United States, which were written over the years. The Declaration of Independence is the most influential part of the English translation, and in many ways is the most important part of that historical record. This book was in the history of the United States from 1790 to the present, during the reign of Richard III, and of the British government until the first half of the twentieth century.

WASHINGTON (RNS) - Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) told a Senate Finance Committee committee Tuesday that his committee will consider whether the current bill to raise the retirement age for military retirees was designed to make it a priority.

"I would say what we're trying to do is make this a priority, to make sure there is a minimum age so we can have some flexibility to do that and then make it work," Corker said.
 
That's an unusual position and the committee may have to consider it when it meets on July 10, or before the expiration of the current six-month "deferred benefit" period, which caps military service for up to nine years.

Corker said Congress had repeatedly passed retirement age reforms as part of its effort to pass the Affordable Care Act, which he called one of the "last great things" in American history.

"I would say what we're trying to do is make this a priority, to make sure there is a minimum age so we can have some flexibility to do that and then make it work," Corker said.
 
The current law, the Veterans Administration Act, has been controversial in the Senate. It prohibits people who retired from serving for more than five years from earning a base salary of more than $200,000 in retirement.

Corker has been on a two-year-long congressional trip where he's expected to work with members of his Democratic and Republican cohorts on an ongoing Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.

"I would say what we're trying to do is make this a priority, to make sure there is a minimum age so we can have some flexibility to do that and then make it work," Corker said.
 
The bill, dubbed the Paycheck Fairness Act, would create a 10-year transition period between when military retirees are 65 and 62 and then, in effect, give the military more flexibility to raise their retirement age and move to a higher age, which is similar to when President George W. Bush took office in January 2001.

"So I will say, the idea is we need a minimum age, where we want to have a base age for each officer that we are going to start over," he said.

"When you have people like this doing the job, it's not really a priority. It's an issue. I don't see it happening. I have the best friend here and a husband and children. And they've gotten through it."

Corker, who is also an experienced senator, said the legislation would make sure there is a "minimum-term-of-care plan" to bring retirees back up to the full age of 60.

"You know what is great about this, Senator, it makes it easier and easier to come back up with what we need to do so we can actually provide benefits that people deserve and not the benefits that are not there."

Corker, who's up for reelection next year, is proposing that all service members, regardless of gender, be required to pay at least 15 percent of their income toward a retiree's military retirement.

In recent years, Republicans have been lobbying to expand the retirement age, which is a 20 percent federal minimum for military retirees, or $100,000.

According to Corker, he has been looking at some suggestions to expand the use of life expectancy to 30. "This is the first time I've been able to do that, and I think there's some good evidence that that would be an effective policy step," he said.

But he called the bill's provisions "unworkable" and said they violate the Constitution.

Corker said the bill did not "promote innovation" in the military.

The ACA requires states to provide health insurance to all their workers. Many states are offering to cover some or all of these health care costs. However, for a large number of employees, that means those states may be required to pay premiums, or not pay anything.

However, there are states that have expanded their eligibility to purchase health insurance in a way that has saved taxpayers a considerable amount of money and resulted in more health-care expenditures.

These laws provide that employers who have employees without coverage are responsible for paying employees and employees' premiums, regardless of whether or not an employer pays . This makes it possible for companies to charge sick workers more than their own employees.

The ACA also protects people with pre-existing conditions from having to provide health insurance.

States are allowed to increase the amount of tax credits they charge for coverage, including pre-existing conditions. However, states must be able to provide health insurance to people with pre-existing conditions. Thus, some people who have pre-existing conditions must qualify for tax credits and

These laws provide that employers who have employees without coverage are responsible for paying employees and employees' premiums, regardless of whether or not an employer pays  health insurance to an employee.

One of the most popular forms of insurance is covered under a private-sector program, the Health Savings Accounts (HSA). Under this program, employers pay employees an amount equal to the employee's contribution to the total of all deductions and credits under the program.

Although insurance costs in the US have risen in recent years, the US government hasn't charged employers the same amount for coverage and has no such plan.

These laws provide that employers who have employees without coverage are responsible for paying employees and employees' premiums, regardless of whether or not an employer pays  employees' premiums.

There are no plans that exclude coverage that would reduce premiums under this provision.

The following table shows a summary of the provisions, if any, that affect employer-sponsored health insurance coverage and those that are not covered by the federal exchange:

Note: The only state with an alternative form of health insurance is Utah.

In Arizona, the state law that requires an employer to cover the medical care of their employees (

These laws provide that employers who have employees without coverage are responsible for paying employees and employees' premiums, regardless of whether or not an employer pays  employees or premiums for their medical insurance or insurance policies. For example, if a state provides an employer with a policy that pays for the employer's medical services if an employee has a preexisting condition, or is a dependent of a covered employer for any purpose, it is the employer that is responsible for paying its costs to provide health insurance to the employee.

The ACA is part of an ongoing effort to overhaul insurance to ensure that all of its citizens have

In 2012, the Center for American Progress, a liberal group, reported that the average American child spends two months each week watching videos that were posted on Facebook that appeared to show illegal immigrants being caught in cross-border raids.

Since then, the number of video views has been flat. But, according to the Center for American Progress, the number of videos posted per minute has exploded since 2013, with 1.9 million to 2.3 million views

In 2012, Obama signed his landmark immigration reform bill into law, and that will be a big step toward fulfilling his promise to work with Congress to enforce the law.

"It may be too soon to say for sure that the number of online users is going to continue to increase. We're already seeing the number of online users reach a

But, according to the Center for American Progress, the number of videos posted per minute has exploded since 2013, with 1.9 million to 2.3 million views  per minute. On average, more than one million people watched content related to criminal immigration enforcement, the group reported.

The U.S. Border Patrol is expanding its border-control programs this year, and the number of apprehensions is expected to rise, said the Border Patrol's David J. Castelli, spokesman.

"It's the biggest surge we've seen since 2012," he said. "More than half of the apprehensions were for

Since then, the number of video views has been flat. But, according to the Center for American Progress, the number of videos posted per minute has exploded since 2013, with 1.9 million to 2.3 million views  being posted by members of the public this year alone. As Pew Research showed in the fall, those who uploaded more videos to YouTube in 2012 were 4.2 percent more likely to watch the same clips in 2013 than in 2012.

Last week, Fox News Channel reported that the number of views posted to its video streaming service, YouTube, has exploded. On the same day, the same group reported that YouTube had seen an increase in views per minute for its

But some video users, such as the Pew Research Center's Mark Wilson, argue that video viewing is an important form of online propaganda.

"I think the Internet, you know, people use it to spread propaganda," Wilson told HuffPost Live's Amanda Henneberg, "when you can use it in a way that is really well-thought out, that is actually going to keep people engaged in the conversation about their

But, according to the Center for American Progress, the number of videos posted per minute has exploded since 2013, with 1.9 million to 2.3 million views  per minute. (The number is still at or well below the 1.5 million views per minute in January 2012, as previously reported.)

The Center for American Progress and the Pew Research Center have all said they think that illegal immigrants are being systematically arrested and jailed because they are looking for new ways to avoid scrutiny in the U.S. media, while those with criminal records also complain that the media has suppressed their voices on this issue.

Since then, the number of video views has been flat. But, according to the Center for American Progress, the number of videos posted per minute has exploded since 2013, with 1.9 million to 2.3 million views  per minute, according to a survey by the Center for Media and Democracy's Media Matters, released this week.

According to the Center for Media and Democracy's Media Matters Survey, 1.4 million people watched video that was posted from December 2008 to October 2012. That number represents a 40 percent increase over 2013.

The new figures underscore a shift in the nature of American policing and law enforcement. The number of days a law enforcement officer receives a tip

Since then, the number of video views has been flat. But, according to the Center for American Progress, the number of videos posted per minute has exploded since 2013, with 1.9 million to 2.3 million views  in the first half of 2015.

"We're seeing huge changes in what we are seeing over the last year," said Matt Beall, program director for American Progress.

According to the Center for American Progress, video-sharing rates are on a decline. "This year's average video views are falling down to just 0.3 per million viewing, or 12 seconds of view a minute," he said.

Since then, the number of video views has been flat. But, according to the Center for American Progress, the number of videos posted per minute has exploded since 2013, with 1.9 million to 2.3 million views  per day, up from a low of 1.7 million in 2013.

The increase has coincided with a steady fall in the number of illegal immigrants in the U.S.

But the real number is an even greater one. Between December 2013 and the end of March 2016, about 40,000 illegal immigrants spent more than three hours of YouTube video watching each day. The video views for the full year were up 9 percent from the previous year.
