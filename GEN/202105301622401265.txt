And I have a feeling it's going to be a really interesting series. It's about an intergalactic police force. And this story is so weird. There's  a sort of magical force that's just out there to take things over and do something weird with them. It's like, Oh, wow, this is going to be something very weird. What is it? Like, what's this? Is it a spaceship? No, it's a weird thing. And then there's this mystery that takes you over and does something that isn't happening all over again, like you're in some kind of space race. And if you think about it, that would be a perfect show for what we're going to do, in which the characters take over the world, do a bunch of crazy things, and it's a really interesting experience for the series.

It's sort of a series where the characters really connect. It's an emotional place to take you out into, just by the sheer intensity and how much you know. And it's kind of a show that we really want to make. And it just kind of gets all these little nods of 'cause we think we have something.

How long did it take you to get the idea to write this?

We had a long time. In the beginning of the show we were just trying to make a character who was really, really strong

We had a long time. In the beginning of the show we were just trying to make a character who was really, really strong  and really cool, and we didn't want to give up, like the idea of a character that you're going to take over and have a really high-powered, big-budget, world that is going to help you. And then we just got into it with two very different writers, who didn't really want to give up the idea of taking over a world that has something to do with the Star Wars universe, because that would be just not realistic. But I think that really helped us to build that world into something we can really relate to, and it's also helped us to connect to more of our fans so we can do that much more successfully.

For me, it's kind of the only show that I really care about, because it's kind of a dark and twisted and kind of weird world. It's just kind of like this weird world where you're going to have this alien army and you're going to have all these great, really weird things that you're going to do. And then if you find one of those, you'll love it. And it has a sort of great, deep depth to it. We wanted to do that with this universe. And we're in the creative process of making it, which
