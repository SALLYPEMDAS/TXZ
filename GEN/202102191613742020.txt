I wanted to figure out where did religion go from there. I'm not sure  we'll ever find out. As an aside, though it will probably be one of my favourite books, it's in many ways a little too political for a middle class city like Vancouver or Calgary. <em>Rationale: It's true, as I said in my previous piece, there were about 7,000 churches in Canada in 1855, so perhaps only about 50,000 were called 'religious' in Canada during the

I wanted to figure out where did religion go from there. I'm not sure  what would've happened if a similar study was done in the United States. I had no idea about the history of religion and what was happening on the Western Front. I didn't know much about Canadian politics, politics of religion, and the political and military leaderships. I started with a historical background: I was in Canada at the start of World War II, when Canada was trying to break away from Japan to fight in Germany. I

I wanted to figure out where did religion go from there. I'm not sure  how much religion was introduced in Canada after 1700. The question is: what is this "history"? We can start with 1700. When I wrote a paper on religion in Canada I felt like that's where I needed to start and this paper wasn't really there. I was so curious about that period. I think I did some research that led to another "happenings" in the United States. It's an old paper by

I wanted to figure out where did religion go from there. I'm not sure  how I will write about religion or Christianity, but my point is that religion, like it or not, had a very specific origin in Canadian politics in the 19th century. From this point of view, I'm just going to go in one direction and draw a general view from it.I am not an historian; I'm going to focus mostly on the political and social history of the 19th century as well as the religious, but
