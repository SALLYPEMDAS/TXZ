The ninjas of the blackstone mountains had become restless.  They were about to retreat when the sun went down and a cloud was rising to engulf them. The sky was a crimson mist in black.

An ancient moon goddess had sent out a decree in the sky. She had the power to bring back the spirit of a demon. It seemed that this soul had finally been destroyed in the great battle between Heaven and Hell. The moon goddess had  placed a demon on her throne, which brought her a new power and created an undead spirit that could summon those of Hell and Heaven.

After a long while the goddess passed through the depths of the Earth's crust and came out of nowhere. It was before she was finally able to reach the depths of the Earth and stop the demon. The goddess was so strong that her hand was

 They were about to retreat when the sun went down and a cloud was rising to engulf them. The sky was a crimson mist in black.

An ancient moon goddess had sent out a decree in the sky. She had the power to bring back the spirit of a demon. It seemed that this soul had finally been destroyed in the great battle between Heaven and Hell. The moon goddess had  sealed the demon's presence inside the earth.

Her soul was sealed in the earth's underworld. The moon goddess had also sealed her own soul inside the earth. And so it had been for over 400 years.

It was as if her world was being sealed, as if she was about to break out of the darkness. She was still in it, and she still had

An ancient moon goddess had sent out a decree in the sky. She had the power to bring back the spirit of a demon. It seemed that this soul had finally been destroyed in the great battle between Heaven and Hell. The moon goddess had  given this soul away and this soul had disappeared.

The dark lord who was now at the mountain was a dark lord of the demon-hunting party. He was the lord of his own army who had killed a large number of demon-hunters and now was at the mountain.

"Ah?"

"This is an illusion of me… I have been hiding

An ancient moon goddess had sent out a decree in the sky. She had the power to bring back the spirit of a demon. It seemed that this soul had finally been destroyed in the great battle between Heaven and Hell. The moon goddess had  sent a divine message to those people who were now trying to revive their soul. It seemed that her power had been used in a different way.

After the soul had been sent back by the moon goddess, she immediately returned to her tomb where it would be taken to fulfill her request. She didn't seem concerned to be about who would receive it. Instead, her name appeared on

The ninjas of the blackstone mountains had become restless.  They had to work harder to avoid the traps that kept them from coming back.

The next night in the city, the first day after the new year, they started their fight against the Nereid invasion. Even if they did not win the battle, they would have achieved their goal, and they would not be afraid of losing.

The next night in the city, the first day after the new year, they started their fight against the Nereid invasion. Even if they did not win the battle, they would have achieved their goal, and they would not be afraid of losing.

Even if they failed the battle,  the enemy would still have plenty of time to advance their offensive, and they would not have to wait very long.

In the end, they reached the town with the most people they had to the south.

"A village called Albedo."

That village was known as a village called Atea.

The village's people spoke English, and the

Even if they failed the battle,  their allies might not.

"We must now get to know the war. We must learn how to control the Nereid Empire." As she spoke, the sound of footsteps and doors of the city filled the streets. At the same time, one could hear a strange sound and the sounds of weapons, which sounded like fire coming from within the city.

The next night in the city, the first day after the new year, they started their fight against the Nereid invasion. Even if they did not win the battle, they would have achieved their goal, and they would not be afraid of losing.

Even if they failed the battle,  it still won for them. Because they were finally able to take the cities of Oor, and they would not be the ones to destroy everything, they did not have to worry about how the Nereids would react, even if they did destroy their weapons.

"But now, we are all alone. This is for the future. This is not a fight for us."

The next night in the city, the first day after the new year, they started their fight against the Nereid invasion. Even if they did not win the battle, they would have achieved their goal, and they would not be afraid of losing.

Even if they failed the battle,  they could still win.

But, for them, it would also be like watching a fire.

In other words, it was the same way as when one had a fight with an enemy but you did not want to face it with your own power.

The ninjas of the blackstone mountains had become restless. 

As soon as the four of them reached the top of the mountain peak they rushed across the surface.

When they reached their destination there was a sound like a heavy bell, and the sounds sounded like people who had been crushed by their weight. The ninjas slowly drew the fire, and the flames began to spread. In a few minutes, the sound of the bell had

When they reached their destination there was a sound like a heavy bell, and the sounds sounded like people who had been crushed by their weight. The ninjas slowly drew the fire, and the flames began to spread. In a few minutes, the sound of the bell had  been heard again.

"Eh?"

"Eh?"

"Hmph. It doesn't matter if the person isn't strong. Although the person who has been crushing your body has got stronger than you, but not strong enough, they still need to keep their spirit spirit alive as well."

The ninjas looked at each other with bewilderment.

When they reached their destination there was a sound like a heavy bell, and the sounds sounded like people who had been crushed by their weight. The ninjas slowly drew the fire, and the flames began to spread. In a few minutes, the sound of the bell had  died out, and the ground began to turn crimson.

The area around them was the same as the mountain that had been previously covered. The first floor was completely covered in red, while the next floor had no longer an increase of red.

As they reached the second floor, the flames began to spread throughout.

"Who were you and what were you doing here

The ninjas slowly drew the fire, and the flames began to spread. In a few minutes, the sound of the bell had  grown stronger, and the flames spread far away.

In the same instant, a few people were injured in a very frightening manner.

"Bang!"

The one who was injured was a young man who was wearing an orange dress. He was running quickly, and he felt like he had a pain in his thigh, as his hand felt like it was being pulled back

The fire spread all over the village and the ground, as well as the surrounding woods. Some villagers were also shocked by the situation.

They immediately rushed out, and the four of them arrived just after it became clear. The three of them immediately entered the forest and they immediately got into a position to make sure everything is well before

The ninjas of the blackstone mountains had become restless.  On the day of the first attack, the demon's face looked sad and sad, and at the same time, it was a gloomy one.

"Haa, the people here are so tired and sick, we must make them wait for us for a while longer than the last time…"

"W-wait a second! You can see the pain we have caused!"

"What a pity!"

"It's true! We've caused the pain that many of us have experienced on a daily basis, and this is all because of you!"

She had said it in another world, and she knew that she would have an easier time dealing with this one.

Even though this world was the place of many people dying, there

"W-wait a second! You can see the pain we have caused!" 

A small, yet well-fed animal was lying on the ground, but the demon suddenly disappeared.

No matter how many monsters appeared in the vicinity, there would always be two that appeared.

The demon's face was very pale and thin, with a deep expression. He was dressed in white and was about fifty or sixty centimeters tall.

"I don

Hinari was silent for a while, only then, he said to a strange face. It was a familiar face, but it was too late to save them from our evil gaze.

At this time, a sharp sound of light came from the middle of the sky, and a red-colored beast came flying out of the sea. It was an enormous dragon,

"No, I didn't make them wait that long! The demon is not afraid of me… and it's my fault that he would do that. He is an angel!"

"What's a demon?! It doesn't matter whether I made the demon happy or not, why would he fight in my place?!"

"Because it is just for you to see
