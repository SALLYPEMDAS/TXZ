Beelzebub 's wife, Asha (Reeb, whose only daughter was killed by Asha's grandfather), was the only one who didn't think that being named Asha would get them all killed. This made Asha seem more and more like a father figure, even if Asha was much more important to her, and she was also a child of the ruling family who could never be known as a murderer. While she would occasionally be seen with Asha on their travels, she was always known as one of the few who was the kindest, kindest and kindest towards Asha. She was extremely loving and gentle to the child, and always seemed to be around every single moment. When she became pregnant, she could be seen smiling down on Asha, and that made Asha feel like she was having a baby.

The main reason for her becoming pregnant was her love of Asha. She felt as if she was taking care of everything around her, and the child always knew that her family always supported her, especially when Asha was away from home. She would tell Asha that she should be happy if she could stay in school. However, it wasn't really that simple. She thought about every other person that she was

She thought about every other person that she was  with at home, but every time she made them worried, the one she was with kept asking for some help and was very worried and angry.

It was an important thing for her to be seen as one of Asha's people, especially if she lived on a lot of land.

"If you want, you can stay at the family home, you won't be taken by the people who want you to stay in the house."

Asha thought about this, then said "Let's try it. I'll go for my flight. I'll send the others over to be with Asha."

"We're going, I'll do that too."

Asha was so excited, but then she couldn't help but think that something might go wrong. At the same time, she thought of things that went wrong, but never thought about what would happen if she didn't stay. This was because even if she hadn't lived, her family was still part of her family. There was no way that they would not have seen her in front of Asha in the middle of the night.
