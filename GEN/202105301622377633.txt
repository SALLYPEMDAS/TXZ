The B-52 Blackbird was first tested in the late 1980s as part of the "Enochian Theater" project, in which members of the famed C-17 Flying Fortress flew B-52S bombers from both their North and South Florida bases. By 1991, more than 6,000 B-52S bombers had been flown , and the last of the B-52s would arrive on U.S. soil in January 2001, flying with the U.S. Air Force's 82nd Airborne Division and the Air Force's 5th Fleet.

Today's B-52s represent an impressive and timely example of the U.S.'s technological superiority.
