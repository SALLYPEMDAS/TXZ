Lighthizer said the TPP, as introduced last week, would create a new "trade union of civil servants" to strengthen U.S. interests abroad.

The pact would put the United States in the same position  as the Canadian government, which has an agreement with China on the U.S.-China trade deal.

Lighthizer said there are not other international trade and commerce deals that would benefit U.S. interests outside of the United States.

"We've not done trade treaties with our neighbor, but we have done trade agreements with other countries," he said.

There have been multiple reports that the United States had "significant discussions" with China and that they were prepared to meet at the summit.

The White House also told NBC's "Meet the Press" last week that it "absolutely" believed the TPP would be a successful deal.

"It was clear to everyone in the public arena at the summit, the president, that he believes he is a significant stakeholder in the deal," White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on CBS.
