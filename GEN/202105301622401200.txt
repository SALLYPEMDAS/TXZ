And I have a feeling it's going to be a really interesting series. It's about an intergalactic police force. And this story is so weird. There's  a character named Calexia who is actually a detective and is investigating a crime. And she is the only one who can solve this story in this way; she is the only one who can put things right for her, which is what Calexia does. And the first chapter I think you're going to see in season 1 is just, "You know, this is really weird and I am very glad I don't have to put it past you because it's kind of a nice feeling. I don't care what you do, and it's so cool that there's a detective on the side, that's why he is so much cooler and a lot more creative than his brother. He is going to do it and it's very cool."

—Calexia on Star Trek Into Darkness

You've done a bunch of shows with the characters on board, and you've written some of them, like "Lost" and "The Unwanted", and you've done some of them with other people. What is it about these characters that drew you, and why did you choose Star Trek?

I would say Star Trek is a great, fun series for all kinds of people. And some of the other

I would say Star Trek is a great, fun series for all kinds of people. And some of the other  shows that have really embraced it—there are some shows that have really been really, really good about them. That makes me want to do a lot of new shows, I guess. I'd rather be doing something that can actually help people than do something that is just the way people think about the show. I'm still really happy with the show, so it's not that I'm not going to be doing more stuff. I would say Star Trek was a lot of fun because the characters, people, their personalities, their motivations—all of these things and stuff I did to help bring those characters into this show.

And now there's this Star Trek universe that I do not like, though I can say it's not that bad. So I feel like if I wanted to do something like that, I could go back, go back to "Lost" or "The Unwanted", or even try to do some stuff with them. But there's a lot of stuff that I just can't do. The one thing I love about the show is that if it's something that you can just stick to, I can think about and find the characters that I want to read about and just like make them into something. And I think that
