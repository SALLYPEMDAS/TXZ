the snowmen are watching  to see whether the birds will be able to fly away from the icy and warm air they will be flying through, for we know that this can happen in summer and winter.

In the middle of the snowstorms, the birds should make some sort of attempt to avoid being caught by the snowflakes, for that could cause them to turn off the air, or even fly around the house and try to get away from the snowflakes. In that case, it's best to take steps to minimize your risk of being caught by the snowflakes. If you think you may be being caught by the snowflakes, see this video about how to keep your bird safe:

A woman who had fled to Bulgaria to visit her older sister in Poland told Amnesty that her family, which had recently been separated from her, had been targeted with racial hatred after the brutal attacks were found on the streets of the city on Sunday.

A woman who had fled to Bulgaria to visit her older sister in Poland told Amnesty that her family, which had recently been separated from her, had been targeted with racial hatred after the brutal attacks were found on the streets of the city on Sunday.

They described a period of intense harassment that their neighbours experienced between December 2016 and April 2017 when they were mostly seen by Roma men, Roma women and men from ethnic minority communities who were often homeless and often the victims of abuse or forced marriages.

According to the  group, these victims have been beaten, robbed and sexually assaulted, who have experienced rape, forced prostitution, forced marriage, forced marriages, and were killed in revenge.

In a video that was posted on Amnesty International's website (below), a representative of the group, who is based in Italy, said, "For us, it is also our first time ever encountering violence in a place where we live in a democracy where everybody has rights. I hope that it will lead to more people in Italy to come and speak out against abuse. However, there may not be many people left who will speak out about such things, especially given the current environment."

The group believes that there is a need for an international dialogue on Roma migration, particularly around this issue of abuse.

"The lack of human rights for migrants from these countries is a problem," said the representative, adding that the government is "very aware" of the issues facing Roma women and children, "and the police should take care of them as soon as possible."

But there is one other thing that is not a problem in the Czech Republic — it seems there is still a lot of time for this kind of abuse to be reported.

The group was contacted by Amnesty International via our Italian-language website and spoke to a couple of representatives from a community that was affected by the abuse. According to their website, the group was able to receive an update from the Czech Republic government at the end of April. According to their statement, "Czech authorities have
