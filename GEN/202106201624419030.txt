---- Pie (Spicy Potatoes)

This one just doesn't get any better than the crunchy potato pie we saw last week. If you're looking for a good way to use up a little more potato and cheese flavor, go for this spicy potato pie. The meaty potato is crispy and flavorful and the sauce is perfect for filling a big pie with cheese or potato salad. You  can also add a dash of olive oil if you want to help it be just as juicy and tender.

You don't have to worry too much about filling the pie or filling any other foods, because it's just gravy. Just stir in the gravy and enjoy.

These little bites come together well with the crunchy potato and cheese flavor that's a hallmark of this pie.
