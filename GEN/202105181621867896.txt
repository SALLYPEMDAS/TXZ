After the first snowfall was complete, they saw the Queen of Snow in a long dress with silver rings. She was wearing a large hat with gold embroidery embroidered on it.  She looked quite nice as she looked like she had changed from the queen she was wearing at the time of the snowfall.

"W-what is going on?"

"Aaah!"

"It's snowing and we are in the middle of the snow!"

"It is!"

"It's snowing and we are in the middle of the snow!"

"It is!"

"You guys can get back to your own little world soon ! But for now, you guys are still staying the same!"

At that moment, a big sound rang out.

In the snow, a man dressed in black arrived. He was tall and muscular with great chest hair and a large, handsome face. He was sitting at a small table, just the two of them chatting.

He was sitting on the side of

"You guys can get back to your own little world soon !"

"Yes!"

"If we can make it back to the capital this time!"

"This is for the King, the Queen, the Family, the King and a whole bunch of your children, okay?"

"Yes! Please do not take this seriously!"

He was a lot too polite for the Queen to say such a thing.

"You guys can get back to your own little world soon , my sweet!"

Her voice filled with pride and she was already moving on to her next activity.

"I would like you to go back to the castle. It's an amazing place to stay, not only for your sake, but also for my daughter's sake. There are so many places to live here, but only one can make a difference."

She didn't want to let them get their hands on her, so she started taking a deep breath.

"Yes~"

"Waa, huu~"

"I can't even get back to my house~"

"Well then, I'll start taking all the supplies and go to my room~"

After the first snowfall was complete, they saw the Queen of Snow in a long dress with silver rings. She was wearing a large hat with gold embroidery embroidered on it. 

The Queen of Snow, that looked like the Great Queen of the world, had a long dark hair and was wearing dark green clothes.

She looked like a beautiful woman, only her eyes had a red tint to them, that had the power to make all things a scene of fear.

The people who followed the King and the Queen of Snow were all in shock

The people who followed the King and the Queen of Snow were all in shock , while they would be surprised by what happened to the Snowmen who were surrounded by the Queen. The Snowmen didn't want to look like they would go into a dangerous situation, while the Queen of Snow wanted to know about the true meaning of their situation.

However, this was a lot more difficult than they thought.

In any case, the Snowmen were extremely

"This is the Snow Queen of the world!" shouted the two most powerful people.

At that moment, all of them went to the center of the room and looked at the queen.

"A king? This is the Snow Queen of the world? She will take my blood into her own hand!"

"I have no other choice but to be

「 … …. Well, just what do you want? The king should send the Queen and her bodyguards to the world's capital. There are about 10 or so nobles in the empire, and the ones who want to come after the King will find a way.

"That is a demon! A demon, just like your father!!"

In the scene of chaos.

If it were a woman who looked just like her mother, she would probably fall into a pit, and thus the situation would be difficult.

The Queen of Snow was really a demon, her face would only make people lose their minds.

"Princess Snow-sama, this is really strange. The Queen of Snow has a very strong sense of honor, and you have been trying to raise a beautiful princess like this before? Do you see a problem?"

"Princess Snow, what is this strange sense of honor? When I saw you, I was so  shocked. How could you see my power like this? I wonder if the power is strong enough."

"You are so arrogant, how could your words make you feel that way?"

It's a strange feeling. In the first place, the Queen of Snow's face has grown, so there's no doubt that she's thinking this way.

In the first place

"Princess Snow, what is this strange sense of honor? When I saw you, I was so  happy because this is my friend."

It's not like I'm a monster person so that's not a problem. Just the fact that they are looking at my face with a frown on their face.

"This is the same thing you do every day, don't you think?"

"It's because you're so sad, I know you're crying. You

"…Ah, I have to know. I will only show you this to your prince later on. Princess Snow-sama's parents will be watching this matter to make sure she does not come back."

"Princess Snow, what is this strange sense of honor? When I saw you, I was so  proud!"

With a smile, she said to them.

"You're such a brave warrior. How could I have been so timid? I have a long memory, and you were such a beautiful girl. Even now, when you don't want to get married, I'm very scared.

"I want you to love me so much. Please, make love

The Queen was walking towards the door and the people here were also in shock.

"What? Did you not see her?」
