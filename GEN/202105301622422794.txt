Baelish II is the son of the Dark Lord Nerah of Sarn, and is best known for his involvement in the corruption of the Daedric Queen Malak and its consequences over the millennia. In the final confrontation between Nerah and Baelish, Baelish was killed in a spell, which was attributed to Nerah's dark arts and Baelish was later killed by the Daedric Lord Alikstead.[5]

Baelish II's brother Nerah, a powerful Daedric Lord, sought to reclaim the throne, and with help from the Daedric Lord Anor Lothar, Jarls led him from the White Tower in order to reclaim the realm, and was murdered. After the fall of the Daedric Throne, the Daedric Lords were forced to flee the White Tower, while the armies of the Dark Lord continued to hunt the White Dragon

After the fall of the Daedric Throne, the Daedric Lords were forced to flee the White Tower, while the armies of the Dark Lord continued to hunt the White Dragon . The armies of the Dark Lord were sent to retake the Realm of Dor-Dor, where they defeated the armies of the Dark Lord. After the return of the dragon, the war between the armies of the Dark Lord continued, and it is said that the Daedric lords took control of the Realm and began a new war that would end in a swift and bloody end. Though he could not end the war, the Daedric Lords would not be satisfied to see Nerah fall. The war would continue to spread over much of the lands around Dor-Dor, which is the site of many of the most important city-states. However, there is one area of war that is still unoccupied by the Daedric Lords, where they are using the area in an attempt to expand and invade the region that has always been their home.[6]

The Realm Edit

The Daedric Lords who ruled over the White Tower, and who had come into conflict with the Dark Lord Nerah over this location in the past, have held it in some measure for several centuries. The Daedric Lords ruled over the White Tower's most important city, the Palace of Solitude, and had fought hard to preserve it
