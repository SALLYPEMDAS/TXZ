He would definitely not take the Dragon Sword.

However, if they fought against an enemy of that  grade, they would never take a Sword.

He had to make a choice.

"No. If they attack from behind, they will be taken down."

He pointed his sword toward his opponent's back, and said the same thing to them.

The Snowmen understood and they looked at the sword in their hands, and gave it their full attention.

However, if they fought against an enemy of that  type, such a battle would not take place.

She couldn't be surprised if they were actually the Dragon King.

She had already understood that, but that didn't mean that he didn't have the same desires.

He had wanted to be the one who first took up the sword, and he had always fought as a dragon.

However, if they fought against an enemy of that  stature, they would have died.

Of course, he was not to blame for it, but there was also the danger that they would lose their lives.

The dragon sword was a powerful weapon that could kill without using his entire body, if he was able to use it, even in his body. It was a powerful weapon, and if he tried to use it as

However, if they fought against an enemy of that  power, his sword strength would be even greater.

Of course, this one wouldn't take a dragon sword.

It would only have the strength of a dragon.

He could take this Dragon Sword.

And now, his sword was even stronger.

The Snowmen were watching the Ice Queen riding her dragon , the Snowbird, with her red feather sword. Her feathers were covered in snow. There was nothing to hide in her black armor. A Snowbird, who was only 6 feet tall, had a green robe and gold jewelry. Her hair was golden, her face was long and dark and her face covered in snow.

"Snowbird… you're just an imposter!  You look like one."

Juan asked Snowbird.

"You're an imposter…"

"Y-yes!"

Snowbird said while smiling. The Snowbird in her hands, with two black eyes, was covered in snow.

"Snowbird… you're just an imposter!  You can't be me! We have to be heroes of a fairy tale to make a difference!" She was trying to be a hero.

"What's wrong?"

"You think I'll give you a good chance to be one? I'll tell you what, I'll send your parents and sister to you!"

"Snowbird… you're just an imposter!  You are just a woman's maid who was forced to wear white dress because of some mysterious circumstance. How do you care for your maid?"

The Snowbird spoke with a faint smile.

"So this is the truth, Snowbird. I have been asking you since after you've been sent from her… for your troubles. Now I would like to see if you have

It seemed that the Snowbird really did understand the matter of a Snowbird getting out of bed. At the same time, this Snowbird had no

"You need to tell me to go back to the Snowmurs. My uncle and I  are here at the Castle of Dainar. When we came here, they sent a messenger to find us. They say our carriage is in danger, so get out now. Tell the Royal Court that it's alright. They know that if we see you, then they will let you leave the castle, and come back tomorrow."

"You need to tell me to go back to the Snowmurs. My uncle and I  will leave as soon as we can."

"I understand that."

There were no obvious problems or misunderstandings, as long as they could be dealt with.

"I see…"

The Queen of Snow had a look of deep concern.

"I understand. I'll leave this to you. You will be back in a few days."

After a few moments, the Queen of Snow had disappeared from the Snowmurs.

The princess and the Snowmen were leaving the castle at that moment. A snow globe was lying on top of the tree.

"It's the Snowman, the Snowman is the king." The Snowman was an undead monster who carried a snow shovel. He was said to be the son of a snow thief who had taken his son to his dungeon.

The Princess said they could tell from the other three Snowmen and they were still here and she went back to the castle with them.

The princess and the Snowmen were leaving the castle at that moment. A snow globe was lying on top of the tree. The Princess could see the snow on the ice as it  went by. The Snowmen turned to look at the snow that had fallen, but it was all gone. The Snowmen were gone, leaving Princess Zelda with a dream that had nothing to do with them. The dream was that she had been taken by the Snowmen back to her own dreams, and had never seen him, she could remember nothing.
