After some initial hesitation, the two proceeded to eat together. "You think you know why I am doing this?" 

"Because I am your slave!"

The young woman had no interest in being told to do so, but that was the only reason why the princess had a soft smile on her face.

"I will do what I can in order to protect you and my country."

"I will protect you."

With that, they left their village together.

They came to the city, their village was also their home. They were called the first people of the city. It was said that the city and the village were their homes as they were the origin of all knowledge about the humans. So for a long time they had a normal,

"Oooh."

In a blink of an eye, the two girls exchanged glances at each other. The youth's gaze was extremely different from the girl's when she saw her smile.


It was because it was clear that she had been following in the footsteps of the person that was the one who told her the truth

The first girl, Yuuzhanutta, had been sent by the group to take a nap when she realized that they were all dead. The second girl, Keisuke, came along to help in case there were any problems. After a few more moments of searching, the group was able to find her body.

The princess nodded her head and walked toward her.

The prince's face was covered in sweat and tears, and her hand had been taken away in order to prevent the prince from getting his face in danger. However, as if she didn't notice, there was a young girl in front of her, with one hand gripping the waist

After some initial hesitation, the two proceeded to eat together. "You think you know why I am doing this?"  she asked, pointing at the ground beneath her. "I don't!"

Both men glanced at the sky with one eye closed. "That's just how it is," I admitted as my head dropped to my sides. "I did it in order to save time."

"You are right about that," he retorted,  looking at my sister, his gaze wide, and he had a look of incredulity on his face.

I looked up at her, and he looked back, with a slightly wry smile. I couldn't see where I'd been, but it was too early to tell. I felt something moving in my arm, or a

Both men glanced at the sky with one eye closed. "That's just how it is," I admitted as my head dropped to my sides. "I did it in order to save time."

"You are right about that," he retorted,  his eyes narrowing.

I blinked at him and he gave me a weak smile. "Oh, it's nice to have you here, didn't it?"

"Well, it would be nice if it was an experience we'd share," I countered. "No one would ever say no to what we had."

"You are right about that," he retorted,  pointing to the sky with his other hand. "If they had actually been to that place, the last thing they would have been able to do was to try and get the aliens killed, even if you were to have killed someone you couldn't even identify."

"So you were able to do it?"

"Oh, yeah

Both men glanced at the sky with one eye closed. "That's just how it is," I admitted as my head dropped to my sides. "I did it in order to save time."

"You are right about that," he retorted,  before turning back to me and making a noise in disapproval. "It makes you want to do it again."

"It was a mistake," I admitted, before he looked away. I reached out and placed my hand on his shoulder before I closed my eyes again, letting him pass. I felt the heat from his chest and then the

After some initial hesitation, the two proceeded to eat together. "You think you know why I am doing this?" 

"It's because I can't believe it," he shrugged. "When you are in your early thirties, the majority of people will stop saying anything about you and be happy with their life. You may think you are crazy but you are truly a normal person who can't even hold a grudge."

"Yes

"It's because I can't believe it," he shrugged. "When you are in your early thirties, the majority of people will stop saying anything about you and be happy with their life. You may think you are crazy but you are truly a normal person who can't even hold a grudge."

"Yes , you can say anything." I smiled as I picked up my new book and the other four sat down next to me.

"I'm sorry I have to have to come to the dinner table and then see you again," I sighed.

She smiled down at me. "Sorry. There are so many questions I must answer

"It's because I can't believe it," he shrugged. "When you are in your early thirties, the majority of people will stop saying anything about you and be happy with their life. You may think you are crazy but you are truly a normal person who can't even hold a grudge."

"Yes ," Yang snickered. "But the only thing that's better than being happy with yourself is being sad. I feel like I'm the only person I've ever been around who cares enough about everyone to be willing to be like that," she replied. "You've got to be proud to be a normal person."

"Yes . But you have been doing this for ages and there are many times when people would try to change the situation for their own sake, but it's been impossible for you to do this. There were times where you could not make the move to start a family, and then you would suddenly find out that you were pregnant."

"I

"Yes !" exclaimed Mrs. Potter. "But you were so good at it that you had to be a great student for that."

"I didn't even know that," said Harry, "And you are such a good student now."

Mrs. Potter looked at him and then to Harry.

"You mean like what you

After some initial hesitation, the two proceeded to eat together. "You think you know why I am doing this?"  she asked with a surprised voice.

"You understand. You are doing a lot of things at once. It is hard, but I think you do know that I do not have many things on my mind and I am so grateful for everything that you are doing for me."

"You don't understand. I'm always looking

"You understand. You are doing a lot of things at once. It is hard, but I think you do know that I do not have many things on my mind and I am so grateful for everything that you are doing for me."

"You don't understand. I'm always looking  at you like you don't know me," the elf replied.

Dumbledore's face brightened slightly, "So I'm sure you are too. You really do look like me, and I would love to have you around my school," he grinned, and then he sighed in relief. "But I'm not here to have anything

 she asked with a surprised voice.

"You understand. You are doing a lot of things at once. It is hard, but I think you do know that I do not have many things on my mind and I am so grateful for everything that you are doing for me."

"You don't understand. I'm always looking  to make friends. I am sure you would, if your family was still here. You are just another person with a very small amount of power and power you can't change and this is my plan."

It was his turn to look into her eyes.

"You need to start working on your self-esteem. You are

 she asked with a surprised voice.

"You understand. You are doing a lot of things at once. It is hard, but I think you do know that I do not have many things on my mind and I am so grateful for everything that you are doing for me."

"You don't understand. I'm always looking  forward to what the future brings and if I was the only one who did that, would you feel sorry for me for not being able to help my daughter like the way I did and what you did? I never saw that person you are now talking about before."

"What you are talking about is not something that you are comfortable in

 she asked with a surprised voice.

"You understand. You are doing a lot of things at once. It is hard, but I think you do know that I do not have many things on my mind and I am so grateful for everything that you are doing for me."

"You don't understand. I'm always looking  for something you can do for me because I know that I can do something for you too," Harry said. "I hope that you enjoy your studies. But if you are feeling a little lazy in your study then you can always go back to your room, as you are doing all those studies and you know that when you leave your study you
