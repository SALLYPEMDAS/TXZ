Who Watches the Snowmen? 

A few years ago, I read a book by Jonathan Haidt called "In the Beginning, The Snowmen," which said there were only two possible paths the Winter Gods would take:

The Winter Gods take us straight to the beginning of the world —

The Winter Gods lead us up the ice-bound hill,

And say to the Winter Gods, "You will be our guide."

In these books, I'm saying there's nothing between one and the other. It's all a bit like being on the same flight. That's what's so interesting about this book. And it's amazing that it didn't make any predictions. It's about taking us a little closer to the beginning of our world and then going forward, and that's really how it could end up. And it's going to be interesting, I think, to see how things go.

The first story I read was, in fact, actually by Christopher Nolan. He wrote this new version of the world. So, that's the title of the book. And I have a feeling it's going to be a really interesting series. It's about an intergalactic police force. And this story is so weird. There's

In these books, I'm saying there's nothing between one and the other. It's all a bit like being on the same flight. That's what's so interesting about this book.

The first story I read was, in fact, actually by Christopher Nolan. He wrote this new version of the world. So, that's the title of the book. And I have a feeling it's going to be a really interesting series. It's about an intergalactic police force. And this story is so weird. There's  these strange alien races, and then the humans come up with the perfect version of them. And I can't even get to them yet. But it's still going to be interesting. And the idea of the Snowmen is so different from the first story. I'm hoping that there will be a sequel, where you're just getting your head around the book.

So I'll admit that it's exciting to be on this road. This book is one of those books that is just really cool. So it's going to be kind of a surprise for people who haven't read the original trilogy or been following them and not know what that was about. But I'm excited. And I'm excited to see how it all goes out.

If you're interested in the sequel of the Snowmen, you can pick up one of the books from Amazon's catalog. This is an excellent book, it's going to be quite different. And it will be pretty cool.

I just love the book. There are some really cool references.

I love seeing it.

And this is my favorite series in the history of fantasy.

It was great to see you guys at work getting the books done.
