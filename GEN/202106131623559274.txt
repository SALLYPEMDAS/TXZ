Let's talk about parsing the JSON:

This is a very simple example and you will understand how you can use this tool.

Here are some basic steps to do.

Create a file:

$ mkdir build/app $ cd build/app/com.myproject/parsers $ chmod +x build/app/com.myproject/parsers.json $ rm -rf parsers

That's it, the files in the directory should now be parsed using the command you are using for generating.

How about you give it a try? Do you like the syntax it is and how it seems to you? Let us know in the comments below in the thread!<|endoftext|>About This Game

Features

1-4 players

8+ levels to play

4 different levels to complete in different difficulty
