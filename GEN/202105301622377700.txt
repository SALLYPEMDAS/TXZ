"I don't think there is a lot of work that people have done to look at species composition and species distributions and species survival.  It's still very early days of research on the evolution of the human brain and the human heart," he said.

The team's research will be led by a professor at the University of Minnesota and is the first to test a new method of genetic analysis using genomic sequencing. The team used an enzyme known as "genetic modification," or "DNA editing
