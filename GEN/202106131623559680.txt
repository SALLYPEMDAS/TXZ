I'm watching you. 


Pike, do you want to ask why you want to speak?


Pike: It feels right. It feels like he said, "you can't just keep doing it this way, because you're going to get mad at me." And I told him to never do that again. And then I told him to let me go. I'm not going to be the guy who goes, "That's all I want. I'm not going to be your guy." You know what I want? I want to make you happy. And you're going to do what I'm gonna do for you.


Pike: I'm going to do what I'm gonna do for you?


Pike: That's what I'm gonna do for you, the right thing to do. It feels great. That's what I want.


Pike: And you're getting all this support, too. I don't think you understand.


Pike: That's what I'm going to do for you.


Pike: I'm not giving you the benefit of the doubt, no. I'm going to take you to another life.


Pike: You're going to make it okay for him.


Pike: But you are. You're not going to take the whole thing down and you're not going to be the guy who goes, "That's all I want. I'm not going to be your guy." You're going to make you happy.

Pike: Then, P. I am not giving you the benefit of the doubt, no.


Pike: You're going to make it okay for him. I'm not going to be the guy who goes, "That's all I want. I'm not going to be your guy." You're going to make you happy.
