It took the Drexel University researchers a lot longer to reach this point, but in this case, they have finally hit the right target – a way to make it look like every one of our bodies is really only part of the system. The researchers' technique uses a special type of material that, instead of just the carbon-based nanoparticles that are commonly used to make a  particle in the lab, they use on-board materials that can't be directly affected by air.

That means the study has the potential to offer a fundamental new approach to the problem of mass spectrometry – and it's important to note that this new material is much more expensive.

But when they tested out this nanoparticle, it turned out that there's one more layer
