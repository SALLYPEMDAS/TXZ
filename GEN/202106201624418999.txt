This is one of those things I didn't like about the movie. I'm not a huge fan of it—it's pretty bland, and it never gets into the show—but the main character of the film is one of the main characters in Little Black Bean—a very cool character. The entire plot is about how she gets to the beach and  what she does in it, and what she does to earn her wish. She's not a "man" because she is a "woman," but she does have a very masculine side—she's the guy who gets along with everybody and makes her happy.

I don't think that's as true in the film as it seems in this book.
