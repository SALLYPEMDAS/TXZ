The King smiled broadly. "The children are going to be sent home, and the rest will go to their families."

I watched them go and watch. I couldn't believe it. 

The first thing I did was to say to Mrs. King to let her know that her son was gone, and leave his family and friends alone. It was the last thing she wanted. She wouldn't have let the boy go.

She didn't know where he came from or who brought him here. She knew it was

"But you're going to be sent home?" she asked. "How much more will you pay? They will be sent home?"

I watched them go and watch. I couldn't believe it.  The child could have possibly been in danger of dying and being taken away from her mother. The King had already known this too. He knew that if she were to die, he would surely kill her instantly.

Then he opened the door and the men in black began coming in through the other doors. He took in the crowd, and the first sign of violence.

"I think you're about to have your last fight, sir," he said in a voice that echoed in the crowd.

The group went back to the main building to see the man. Then they went to the elevator, where the man had a new chair to stand in. The King had him on the floor, so he grabbed the man's chair and started yelling.
