I've heard that you guys have been posting all over Twitter about your trip to Florida this weekend. We are very glad you guys were part of the trip! How would you recommend it to your family?


Thanks!

I'm a very big baseball fan, but not in the sense that I enjoy watching people lose money by stealing games.

We went to a baseball camp, the camp was very interesting and very fun. We went to a park with baseball in it. And I went down to the park to eat and talk to the people working there. I love baseball. I live here in Miami and I love it.

So, thanks for bringing this to our attention!


Bud.
