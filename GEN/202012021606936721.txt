"When this method of the study had first been discovered, the general idea was that it might be useful for the discovery of various general truths, since the various truths  are bound together by the principle of unity of the soul." â€“ Aristotle

"When this method of the study had first been discovered, the general idea was that it might be useful for the discovery of various general truths, since the various truths  about those truths depend on one another. But this idea was not developed until a further number of different methods of its development were developed at the same time, and yet some of them

"When this method of the study had first been discovered, the general idea was that it might be useful for the discovery of various general truths, since the various truths , if confirmed, would help the scientific character of the method," concludes the report.

"When this method of the study had first been discovered, the general idea was that it might be useful for the discovery of various general truths, since the various truths  might be related to each other through an evolutionary mechanism," he said. "The way forward is to investigate the relation between these principles and the evolution of knowledge."

For that

"When this method of the study had first been discovered, the general idea was that it might be useful for the discovery of various general truths, since the various truths  are in common contact with one another, and that certain of the common truths, like the origin of life, are necessarily independent of others. In all cases, there were three main

"When this method of the study had first been discovered, the general idea was that it might be useful for the discovery of various general truths, since the various truths  could be analyzed simultaneously; as for the theory of the origin of man, we must make such deductions as will permit us to prove it," notes Professor Cauthen. "As

"When this method of the study had first been discovered, the general idea was that it might be useful for the discovery of various general truths, since the various truths  which were not known at that time were necessarily different from those which were learned from them.

"When this method of the study had first been discovered, the general idea was that it might be useful for the discovery of various general truths, since the various truths  might be examined in conjunction with the general principles of science," writes Michael P. Sargent.
