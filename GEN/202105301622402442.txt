The Conservatives, for one, have been in power for three years, and will be elected in November 2014.

The latest round of parliamentary voting will be held on Sunday, October 14, with the election taking place at a time of high tensions over immigration and the EU.

"There's going to be a significant focus on issues that stand at the doorstep of the House of Commons, which we do have concern about because this parliament is going to be a major international vote in the future," said Michael McBride, the head of the parliamentary candidate review group.

"That means there will be a large number of voters out there who are not comfortable voting with us on important issues."

The vote in which MPs from a range of parties vote will take place from noon on Friday to 7pm on Sunday.

"There  will be two major round-robin meetings in Scotland on Monday and Tuesday with the UK Parliament's main sitting on a day before the next general election.

"The majority of all parliamentary constituency seats will be in the Scottish parliament, which means no party has more than 60 MPs in Scotland.

"It's a very close race and this is an important step in this process and we will be making that clear to both the Parliamentary and the Prime Minister.

"As we work towards Brexit, we're ensuring we ensure our parties get the same deal to deliver, which will include more of the same.

"That means there will be a huge amount of support for the party at the upcoming general election.

"It also means that as the parties advance towards the General Election in 2019, the seats we hold will still be at stake."

The Conservatives are expected to win all three of the Scottish seats on Sunday.

The Lib Dems, in their second Scottish election in 12 years, are only now coming close to the Conservatives in the Commons.

The Liberal Democrats have a majority of four seats, while the Nationalist Party's holds two.
