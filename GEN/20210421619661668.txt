Arthur spat the milk out of his mouth  and made sure to shake his hand out. "It'll be OK," he murmured. "It's fine. I can go to the office later."

After a brief moment, Harry's mind started again. If he could get to the office at all, he would have some time before he turned to follow Hermione to a certain  room, where they would get some food, maybe some tea. She would take care of his needs, he would be fine after all.

"Thank you so much," Harry murmured softly as he slowly approached the desk.

With that, the two of them came to a stop, and quickly turned back around, turning the

After a brief moment, Harry's mind started again. If he could get to the office at all, he would have some time before he turned to follow Hermione to a certain  bathroom, where a woman who had been at her hotel looking for him would be in a bad mood, and it would probably take a long time before Harry was able to make the first move.

It was a small, unremarkable corridor in the centre of the room. A lot of it was old and dirty, and Harry was almost

After a brief moment, Harry's mind started again. If he could get to the office at all, he would have some time before he turned to follow Hermione to a certain  shop. As he entered, he felt like he was falling through a roof. He stopped to wait for Hermione to get out of his car. "What happened to you?" he asked.

The conversation between him and Hermione never went any more than one-on-one. Harry was always sure he was going to get an answer,

After a brief moment, Harry's mind started again. If he could get to the office at all, he would have some time before he turned to follow Hermione to a certain  place, he wondered if she would still be there, or what, even if she did not stay. He could do one of those things now, for when he reached the top of the stairs, he knew he would be able to see the girl's room, the way it looked once he'd arrived. His mind tried to figure out if

"Nope!" Ruby said with a wry smile. "She's trying to steal my money back, but I guess she's got a point."

"Nope!" Ruby said with a wry smile. "She's trying to steal my money back, but I guess she's got a point."

Ruby just stared in confusion. "This whole situation really isn't that simple," she mumbled. "You know I don't like being a bitch. It seems  like I deserve nothing more than the things you have. It's not like I need your money to make things right. I am what I am. It's all I can get here."

"She's gonna tell us everything she knows, but right now we're getting dragged into something that's nothing." Ruby said.

Ruby just stared in confusion. "This whole situation really isn't that simple," she mumbled. "You know I don't like being a bitch. It seems  like a lot of people are making fun of me for what I'm doing."

Weiss raised an eyebrow. "What?"

"Just because she wants it doesn't mean she can't pay for it. If she gets out and breaks up with me or makes another attempt, I won't want her to know that I'm a

Ruby just stared in confusion. "This whole situation really isn't that simple," she mumbled. "You know I don't like being a bitch. It seems  a little out of touch for some people."

She took her hand off of the bundle and leaned back in her chair, staring at it for a moment, "Ruby, just like the other guys, if you would just give it up and get it over with. You can have some more control over what's going on with me,

Ruby just stared in confusion. "This whole situation really isn't that simple," she mumbled. "You know I don't like being a bitch. It seems  like the way she uses that as a reason to attack me, is not really in keeping with what you're going through here. You're not going to be fighting the world if you're going to do something like that."

"I see," she said. "I'm just happy to know that you've come out of the shadows

"Why do you do that?" he asked, looking at me as if I was going to do something to him.

"It makes my stomach hurt."

"I can understand why you'd do that, but why do you do it to me?" I asked.

"I'm just a friend, my mom will never like me."

He grinned, then said, "I thought you said I'd hurt you. Well, I guess you should think of it differently now."

"We can call you Mom, maybe," I said, "and you can call yourself Mom because I

"Because we're just friends." 

"I'm not a friend, I just find a way to talk to you about something else you don't even know."

"I know you're right."

I was right, of course, because he's not talking to me. I know I'm talking to you, I know you're his friend.

"Because we're just friends."  He said.

"Don't be angry about that," I protested.

He was more like a brother and a friend than an enemy. I found it a little too much. It seemed an odd way to respond.

When he talked to us, he was always talking to the people he had met in the past,

"I don't care," he shrugged. "I just want to see my wife. It makes it so much more fun to be a partner to me."

"I'm going to have to get my head together and do things, and I can't even do it with other girls, so I just kind of want to

"My apologies for the delay," she said and his eyes rolled back. "I'm sorry for this."

He looked at her, though, and the words spilled out of his mouth. "You're getting the idea that I'm not a pretty girl anymore?"

"No," she corrected him. "You 've got no idea."

She pulled the sheet back to reveal a thin, almost round sheet of silver, and laid it on the table, then laid it back on the edge of his chair.

"But it's just the other day," he continued. "I'm not going to sit there and tell you how beautiful my

"But I'm not your sister," he grumbled. "You were a little too young to be her sister. And I'm not even your cousin."

"No," she corrected him. "You  look exactly the same as I did. I did like that."

She pulled his face from her.

"You didn't know that," he admitted. "I guess you were never told."

"Okay, I was."

He stood, then took a step back. "What was it that I said?"

"I love you," he said, taking his hand from her neck. "Love you too."

This was not to be. He'd only been home for two days before taking his second nap.
