The story ends on a happy note, because everyone knows who the heroes were and that they killed them and they want to kill them so they are all like "Yeah! All of them. All of them.

Criminal justice is the pursuit of justice  by justice, and criminal justice was created in part to provide these resources for people's lives. It was originally a way to find a way for people to live, but it also allowed for people to be free from fear that was associated with incarceration. They couldn't be arrested, because they couldn't be held accountable for crimes that had been committed against them. To them, no matter what their background, no matter their religion, or even if they were criminal, they were always guilty of crime because they were criminals. They could not do anything to change that. There was no way to fight back against that.


The criminal justice system is a process that allows people to be free from fear and for them to experience peace without having to be incarcerated. Those who are convicted are sentenced to spend months in prison. It's a harsh punishment, and then those people get a chance to grow out of the system and go back to the society that they come from. This is a system that does not allow people to know about their crimes or how to get out. They are not taught. They are never allowed to say that the criminal justice system works for them.
