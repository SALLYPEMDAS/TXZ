I heard from a guy named Michael called Juri who said this thread was very good...and also that he'd like to see me again too! That's good! Juri! !!!

I received a few messages on Twitter this morning. Apparently my article about Mr. Otakajima had been featured in The Guardian (a UK newspaper that is in Japan) in addition to other media outlets such as Daily Mail (London), The Independent (Scotland), Financial Times (London), The Sun (UK), The Telegraph (USA) and others. I don't really want to get caught up in this, but they told me it was an important piece that was included by accident. I didn't read it very closely before putting it up, but it is important to me. And I think it's important to anyone who sees it
