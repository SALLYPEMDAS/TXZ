This could only be described as strange magic. There were four parts to the beast, but what was more, all the parts were incredibly dense and could withstand its current physical impact. As the shape of the monster changed from humanoid to beast, the form the dragon took would no longer match the one it held. The Dragon of Earth would  not only lose its human form but also the human form of the one it held, allowing it to pass its own form to a different animal. This new form, the Dragon of Heaven, could be made an entire race of dragons or a sub-species of all those that were created by the god.

As the shape of the monster changed from humanoid to beast, the form the dragon took would no longer match the one it held. The Dragon of Earth would  once again enter the world with a powerful magic that could kill a human, and he would now be the strongest of the dragons. This was clearly the beginning of the change that was already occurring, and as the changes in magic came closer, so did the strength of the beast.
