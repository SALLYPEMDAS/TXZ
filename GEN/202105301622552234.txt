Their adventure will lead them to the town of Eden, and what's more, it's the home of the "C" team, the mysterious duo who have set up an alliance  with a group of heroes that will bring peace to the world.

But what kind of a world would the "C" team be created in? It's a story about the world of Eden that's been shrouded in secrecy since its beginning - one that, like many other fantasy universes, has remained shrouded in mystery and mystery until now.

The book is set at the beginning of the year as a prequel to the 2014-15 "Dragon Age: Origins" series.

It's the conclusion to the year-long series about the journey of four noblemen who are summoned to defend their home world from the threat of the dragon.

In the event that they are ultimately victorious, the characters of each of the four sides is called to serve as their allies.

The books are called "Legends," but it's the "Dragon Age" stories that get most of the attention this year - the original Dragon Age stories in particular, for a number of reasons.

In those stories, characters are chosen based on their abilities, and their relationship with the world, or their actions.

Some of those heroes, such as Hawke and Hawke's youngest brother, have a long history with the world, and

Some of those heroes, such as Hawke and Hawke's youngest brother, have a long history with the world, and  are sometimes in the world for longer periods of time, like the past couple of years in the books.

The team may include some heroes that weren't initially involved with the series, but that are now in the world. And they're more powerful than the heroes originally set up, like a hero like Hawke's twin brother, the Dragon Age's main protagonist, Dagon, who is a warrior who would go on to have many adventures in the series.

In the books, the players are asked to join the C team of heroes to confront the dragon. The heroes are also given a number of important characters to fight against, including the Dragon Age's other main heroes, a small group of adventurers who are sent to rescue them from the dragon.

It may seem like more of a journey than the "Dragon Age" stories we've heard so much about so far, but that's the reality of many fantasy series.

A lot of people still don't know a lot about the series, and it's difficult to talk about the series in depth - but it's an interesting and interesting project to tackle.

The team, with its story's multiple heroes and their relationship with the world, could be a fascinating and diverse
