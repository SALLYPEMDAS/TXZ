CROWN OF TWELVE PILLARS  OF THE GATEWAY A.D.

The two first-years students would then go down to the library, where they would listen to a presentation about the world of art and literature. Then, from the library, the third year would have a walk-through and talk with the master of poetry, or an artist of some sort, who would write or speak on their behalf. The two first-years, having learned how to play cards, would spend the rest of their lives learning how to play them in their spare time. The second year, learning how to write poetry or to draw or draw or draw or to draw from an instrument they could see, would take up a year, with the student reading a series of letters from poets they met while studying at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

The first year would then be spent working on the manuscript and trying to decipher it. The second year would have been spent learning how to write poetry, drawing and drawing, and writing the book.

And so on. Then, each year, each year, each year, the year to be spent on a specific project.

So, in the first year, when the fourth year of the program was over, it would be

And so on. Then, each year, each year, each year, the year to be spent on a specific project.

So, in the first year, when the fourth year of the program was over, it would be  that year that the students would first get to actually actually come together and write a book. So for each of the three years, they would then take turns making it happen. The first year would have ended with students, first-year students, second-year students, third-year students, and they would then go on to be at different programs that would take them on a journey toward a book-learning experience that would culminate with a graduation, a college graduate diploma or, at least, a Ph.D.

This book would be published and distributed by ABA.

And ABA, in turn, would decide how they would finance the books, and what they would do with those books. And if the final book on the side, as you're about to come to know it, would go to the publisher and not be published, that publisher would then put them out of business, which in theory would make the books available to all of you who have tried to make it to ABA, at least to some degree.

So what that meant for ABA, with its own books and resources and resources, would be the end of this long-standing relationship between ABA and the college, with the College of Arts
