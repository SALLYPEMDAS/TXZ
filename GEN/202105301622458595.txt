The Pirate's Fate
-----

The Pirate's Fate  is the ultimate story about Pirates who believe in a "secret society," which they believe will preserve their freedom and independence.

"The Pirate's Fate" is an ongoing story of the survival of the Pirates in an era of digital and industrialization that has seen the "pirate trade" industry burst into global prominence. The pirate economy continues to grow, but it is slowly dying, too, and the people who pay the taxes are living a different kind of nightmare. As with the Pirate's Fate, the story focuses on the lives of the Pirates' main characters, which have always been deeply tied to their own actions and goals: an American citizen, a business owner, an artist, an entrepreneur, a pirate.

It's a beautiful tale, and it's worth a watch as the film is screened in the city of Pittsburgh. But as with the Pirate's Fate, this time around, we will see just a small slice of the story.

"Pirate's Fate" has been screened at the Film Festival this year, and is scheduled to be distributed at the San Francisco International Film Festival in 2018.
