I sat in my seat in my office chair, which was a bit over 6' by 12' tall, covered in  a bright red coat and jacket. I felt as if I had been in bed for 10 minutes. On top of me I saw a group of women, including two who were also men, and said I needed to leave. The woman walked into the living room where

As you can imagine, I am quite intimidated and have never said any bad words. When
