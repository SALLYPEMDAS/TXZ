The Path
-----

The Path  to Exile (also known as Path of Exile 2.1) was a game-play demo that featured a new style of PvP, as well as a new hero for the first time ever and a brand new storyline that was inspired by the Warcraft universe. After several failed attempts at PvP, Blizzard announced that it had officially ended the beta of the game at the end of September. In June of 2009, after a three year campaign by a group of players known as the Rovine, the game was released on all three platforms.


Despite these changes, the gameplay remains the same, but now players who were able to obtain items for this new style of PvP were able to go into dungeons, fight for real treasure, and level up their characters with some extra loot and gold. The gameplay was also a huge boon for the community. Many players came through the beta with an incredible understanding of the game. They are still very much an active player, and the community has shown they are willing to put up with some of the more ridiculous content in the game for a while.

The Rovine has recently had a new hero in the form of Lord Commander, who was one of three new playable classes in the game. He is also known as  the Death Guard. He is a massive, multi-handed melee fighter that can outscale his opponents in a long long sword duel. His main stat line is a single-handed assault, with a base attack of 12. However, he is also proficient with both melee and ranged weapons, as well as two special abilities: his ability to heal himself instantly, and his ability to increase his attack power as his attacks and power increase.

The Death Guard is one of the most feared heroes in the game, and is quite simply the worst fighter in the game. He can go up to four enemies at a time with his two ranged attacks, and he is not as fast as most of the other heroes in the game. Despite this, the Death Guard still holds up well, as he will not attack players who are already under five levels. In the end, he would be the best choice for a good PvP fight because of the speed and damage output he receives from his special abilities. He is also one of the best ranged combat fighters in the game, and even though he has a little bit of speed, he still does not reach as much as most of the other heroes.


The Death Guard's attacks have an attack of 8. His secondary
