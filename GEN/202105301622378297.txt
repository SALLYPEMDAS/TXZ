The Ants   watched this video, so this is what I thought:
There's a good chance that my eyes are full of tears and the tears are really big, just for a split second. I had to be in the wrong situation and it's not really necessary to ask to get on the show. That's probably the only thing you have to know about

That's probably the only thing you have to know about  the actual emotional scenes in the show, in this show. So I will keep it simple. I think that I should make it look like this picture, since it's so funny. The entire time I was watching it I was so upset about it. It seems like that they used some type of language or a certain scene of what people are trying to say
