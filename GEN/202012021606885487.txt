His comments about a social media account on which he has published his messages are in line with other comments he has  made against women, said Lisi.

"I've said my point of view is that I don't want to do things that are offensive," he said. "It's a very sensitive subject and people are not going to want to look at women's rights and other issues in their life."

He said that when asked by a reporter about the comment that he was angry at those on social media, his reply

His comments about a social media account on which he has published his messages are in line with other comments he has  made about the campaign in recent weeks in which he referred to Clinton as a "fat fucking bitch" who "sides with feminism".

Sanders called for Clinton to be stripped of the US Senate seat she holds in Vermont, where he has been campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination. But he also said he would not make that a "proclamation" - a reference to the Democratic party's decision to expel Sanders from the

His comments about a social media account on which he has published his messages are in line with other comments he has  made on Twitter.

The post on the Twitter account, entitled: "#MeToo," features a picture of himself and two other celebrities in a t-shirt and sunglasses, writing: "Thank you all for taking the time to do this. I know that's something to think about, but there is no way this could go viral. This is personal. I am not the one to get into personal attacks on people.

His comments about a social media account on which he has published his messages are in line with other comments he has  made about Facebook in the past. In May, he admitted to posting comments online about an alleged online video of a 16-year-old girl, who had been bullied.

Authorities  said at least 70 buildings were evacuated in the area, while 1,000 people gathered to watch the scene as the tornado tore through a small village of 100 residents.

In St. Paul, officials said they had a tornado warning for the city and urged residents to stay in their homes and report their home or apartment to emergency services, the St. Paul Times-Star reported.

The blast sent people fleeing, but there was no immediate word on what caused the explosions. No injuries were reported, according to the police.

No one has been arrested in connection with the blasts.

Police told the local Fox 5 affiliate it is still unclear how many people were affected. The blast killed three people in the area, police said.

They were interested in how the  wolves and moose used their bodies as a kind of "trees" for nesting.

"We thought, 'Well, how could they possibly see what they have on the back of a tree?' So we set out to investigate how this is possible and we got there," Dr. Kline said.

They were interested in how the  animals get in with each other. For instance, a rabbit can go through a period of heat and drought when it is most active and it can be fed as soon as it can be out of water.

When a human group of animals congregates and mates, it's an activity that scientists often consider non-species. A few animals that have been shown to breed in captivity are known to breed in captivity, including a

They were interested in how the  population of a single wild-caught ant colony might fare against those with a greater number of colonies.

They tried to find the spot in the center of the study where some of the ants congregate. They found this. The ants have an unusual pattern of nest formation. The colony may not be nearly as diverse as the ants that congregate with a similar pattern.

Instead, the researchers noticed three groups of

They were interested in how the  animals behave, and how much it matters to their own behavior.

"We were looking at how the animals interact with the environment and if the interactions were meaningful and relevant for the breeding of their animals," Dr. Kline says. "There were quite a few experiments that looked at the relationship between the presence of a specific group of animals and their behavior, and that led us to the role of the presence of other groups

Dr. Kline's team wanted to find the spots where the animals congregate to breed, to see whether a particular population of animals could be considered a part of a larger group.

They were interested in how the  animals were interacting with other animals in the forest and had their data collected from a number of locations in the forest.

The team of researchers turned to one study in Wisconsin that looked at about 100 million-acre forest habitats in five different settings: northern Minnesota; northern and eastern Oregon; southern California; northern Michigan and northern and eastern Pennsylvania. They found that there were a number of different groups of animals that were found on nearly

They were interested in how the  animals congregate in the forest. They found that when people move their hands in a circle, their paws are less likely to stick to a tree.

That pattern of movements led Dr. Kline to say that the animals that congregate in these areas need protection.

They were interested in how the  animals might act in areas of high humidity and high water.

The research showed that the large groups of species living near the low areas of the vegetation -- a high percentage of the tree rings, shrubs and flowers -- were more likely to be affected by the cold and high humidity.

The researchers also found that the low-level groups of animals congregating in low-humidity places such as shrubs and flowers

In April 2012, glaciers in West Greenland, which are the home of the most massive glaciers, were not so clear-cut, and the record melting rate in the South Atlantic in 2012, which occurred before the record melting in  the South Atlantic, was not so clear.

Yet on October 22, 2013, a snowfall of 6.2 millimeters was reported over parts of Glacier Sava in the South Atlantic, the third highest recorded level of snowfall in three years. It was at least 30 centimetres (22 feet) in the Southern Hemisphere, just shy of the record of 7 centimetres (3 feet) in 2012.

In April 2012, glaciers in West Greenland, which are the home of the most massive glaciers, were not so clear-cut, and the record melting rate in the South Atlantic in 2012, which occurred before the record melting in  Antarctica, was also not so clear.

"The data is very important," said David K. Burt, a professor at the University of Arizona and co-author of the latest study. "It's very clear what a lot of people are thinking."

The last ice age record is set in the 1980s by the collapse of a giant iceberg of ice over Greenland. It was one of the most dramatic records

In April 2012, glaciers in West Greenland, which are the home of the most massive glaciers, were not so clear-cut, and the record melting rate in the South Atlantic in 2012, which occurred before the record melting in  2012, was too rapid, the International Ice Sheet Association (IRSA) said last month.

The Arctic is home to a number of other big glaciers, including the largest, Stalingrad, which is estimated to hold at least 14 million tonnes of ice. That brings it nearly half the amount of ice that the U.S. is carrying. The rest is covered in snow, ice cream and snowflakes,

In April 2012, glaciers in West Greenland, which are the home of the most massive glaciers, were not so clear-cut, and the record melting rate in the South Atlantic in 2012, which occurred before the record melting in  2013, occurred in the middle of a year when it was expected to be warmer and melt at that location. That last point came with a lot of ice in March 2013 and a small snowfall on the slopes of Mount Sinopec (a smaller ice sheet).

The two glaciers have a similar historical pattern, with their melt rate, size, and composition dropping when the melting is first visible, rather than being recorded in

In April 2012, glaciers in West Greenland, which are the home of the most massive glaciers, were not so clear-cut, and the record melting rate in the South Atlantic in 2012, which occurred before the record melting in  El Boring and El Boring Valley was reached, was too small to explain.

As for Greenland, the ice sheet was too thin and the glaciers had already been pushed out. Glaciers at both the East and West sides of Greenland formed over the summer and winter, which is a key time for melting, as these parts are relatively vulnerable to winter-ending melt.

As of 2010, the Antarctic Peninsula is

In April 2012, glaciers in West Greenland, which are the home of the most massive glaciers, were not so clear-cut, and the record melting rate in the South Atlantic in 2012, which occurred before the record melting in  the South Pacific, became even more striking, according to new data.

"There is a very strong correlation between the melting rate of glaciers and the increasing rates of ice loss that is happening in the Arctic," said Robert Vachon, a glaciologist at the University of California, Berkeley who has studied the impacts of climate change on the northern coasts of Greenland and Antarctica.

There is also evidence for an important change

In April 2012, glaciers in West Greenland, which are the home of the most massive glaciers, were not so clear-cut, and the record melting rate in the South Atlantic in 2012, which occurred before the record melting in  the South Atlantic was recorded, was the strongest the world has seen since records began.

What does it mean for the future of these glaciers in the Pacific? Will the ice melt and the glacier melting continue and expand into Alaska and into the West? And what kind of ice cover would be required to allow the glaciers to return to their pristine condition?

This year the most dramatic calving event occurred in Antarctica: a massive volcanic eruption, which destroyed most of the continent and killed off thousands of people in South Africa.

This year there is another dramatic event in Europe, which is set to see the largest mass extinction event ever recorded. The world's largest freshwater lake, the Lava Lake, will be the epicenter of this

Under the program, the state government provides rent vouchers  to those who live in homes they want to rent to their neighbors.

Under the program, every two or three years, the recipients receive up to four months of housing support while they wait for an apartment. The recipients also receive a $1,500 housing allowance to pay for their rent and rent assistance.

The bill would reduce the number of homes required to be built and replace those that are not built, but only at the rate approved by the legislature.

The measure would apply to up to 1,000 rental units or, if no one's house is built, up to 1,000 dwellings or two-bedroom units or one-and

Under the program, the state government provides rent vouchers  based on a number of criteria. The vouchers are meant to reduce state and local taxes on utilities and make up for higher property taxes.

After that, Namong said, many households in the poorest families are offered subsidized vouchers.

"They're subsidized with the same subsidies that you get out of your home," Namong said. "The subsidy goes to housing in the bottom half of the income distribution."

Under the program, the state government provides rent vouchers  to residents who pay a minimum of $10 per month, which they use to buy private housing.

While the state did not address the issue of renters paying out more than the minimum for the homes they rent to, it is expected that more residents will pay to buy affordable rental units than households in the bottom two quartiles of income.

Police reported seeing a large shark near the entrance of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, but didn't  name the animal, though local reports say it may have been a black-finned mackerel that was caught in the water. That species does not often catch on board vessels, though, which make it extremely difficult to see it out of the water.

The incident began shortly after 7 p.m. on the Eastbound Interstate 65 near the U.S. 13 Bridge near the San Jose Freeway. Police

In recent years, it's been a bit harder than it used to be for Hollywood to get their foot in the door because there aren't any new and popular movies coming out every year. You have to put your eggs in the same basket as many  of the smaller studios out there, but to truly succeed, you need your actors on stage. This was true even before Marvel released Spider-Man: Homecoming, which was pretty good. But even then, there were actors who didn't appear in some of the big movies, so there wasn't as much room for the rest of the cast.

What's happening here is that we're starting to see a shift. The idea that you can make a good movie without getting anything into the box office is a very outdated notion, but I think that it's more about taking it with a grain of salt than about telling you what it's all about. I don

In recent years, it's been a bit harder than it used to be for Hollywood to get their foot in the door because there aren't any new and popular movies coming out every year. You have to put your eggs in the same basket as many  good things as you can until you hit the big screen. That doesn't happen with all the big-budget films out there, but we're lucky enough to have some of those movies and they make up for the slow-burning burn that it takes for these great movies to get their due. It doesn't mean that this is always the case.

In recent years, it's been a bit harder than it used to be for Hollywood to get their foot in the door because there aren't any new and popular movies coming out every year. You have to put your eggs in the same basket as many  great films you have and there's been no way to make a good film that will go viral again and again. It's not like people are going to go crazy because they've never seen a movie like this.

Now you're in this universe where people have these ideas about how they want to tell a good story, and it's all about trying to stay on top of all the different factors that come into play.

In recent years, it's been a bit harder than it used to be for Hollywood to get their foot in the door because there aren't any new and popular movies coming out every year. You have to put your eggs in the same basket as many  of them and have a different vision of what you want to make.

That's where the success of the original movie is really important. The original story that made it really special and made the original people excited about making something really special, that really inspired the next generation of filmmakers. That's why a lot of times when people ask me about the original movie, I don't go back and say, "Well, it

On the subject of movies becoming mainstream, I think it really depends on what you are going to do with them, to the extent that they are popular. If you're going to turn your movie into a mainstream hit and have no more than

You have to put your eggs in the same basket as many  other studios. That's why we've found a lot of studios that actually don't think about making a sequel, but only want to do the right thing and to make the film as good as possible. It's the same reason people love to see movies like Jaws or Star Wars: the Force Awakens, but when you get to see these other movies, they just can't keep up with what's going on in the world

So what's wrong with this? Let's start with a list of emissions that will kill your car without the slightest harm. You know, to get a sense of how important a part of your car is, you can look at a car that has 4-foot-diameter tires and a high-grade rear seat and assume that it will hit 100

In fact, in many states, cars are allowed to drive off the road while they're parked and without using the rear of the tractor. This practice is so common that the US Department of Agriculture's Institute for Research and Public Affairs recently held a program in which scientists and their clients tested their own cars off the road with the tractor trailer at a local auto

To save you money on repairs you must pay a lot less attention to the gas and diesel exhaust you're supposed to use for your cars, but instead of paying attention to it, just pay attention to how the tire, fuel pump, air conditioner, and the dash are being used.

It's a common misconception that a tractor is too important to take off. In fact, we know that most car owners don't even pay attention to  the odometer. That's because the emission numbers from a truck and truck exhaust aren't completely accurate.

Now, it's important to remember, however, that you don't get a lot of mileage when your exhaust is going out, so your fuel consumption isn't as important. Also, if you are trying to maximize your mileage, you might want to be more careful when you're not trying to maximize your efficiency.
