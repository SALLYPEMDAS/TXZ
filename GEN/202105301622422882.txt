Prince Vassago , a retired army officer and an Israeli general known as "Tibetan" (tobacco, or heroin), is one of the few Americans who's tried cannabis as a drug. He and his wife, Gertrude Vassago, were also arrested in 2014 for cannabis possession in Maryland after they sold hundreds of marijuana plants, allegedly for $70 each. "They made a deal with their police, they bought 10,000 cannabis plants and they made them their business, but there was no way for them to be licensed for recreational use," he told the Washington Post.

Vassago's wife has been on the FBI's case file for almost 30 years, but until recently she wasn't charged.

Now, a recent federal court order shows that Vassago can be held responsible for one of the biggest cannabis busts to hit the US since marijuana prohibition began in 1964. In October 2011, Vassago's wife of 18 years, Rachel, was charged with money laundering.

According to the court order, Rachel Vassago, who is a resident of Virginia and was not even charged with any crimes, bought about 100 marijuana plants from a dealer in Alexandria, Virginia on April 10, 2010

Vassago's wife has been on the FBI's case file for almost 30 years, but until recently she wasn't charged.

Now, a recent federal court order shows that Vassago can be held responsible for one of the biggest cannabis busts to hit the US since marijuana prohibition began in 1964. In October 2011, Vassago's wife of 18 years, Rachel, was charged with money laundering.

According to the court order, Rachel Vassago, who is a resident of Virginia and was not even charged with any crimes, bought about 100 marijuana plants from a dealer in Alexandria, Virginia on April 10, 2010 , and sold them over six months for about $100 each.

"Rachel Vassago, whose sole employment is helping to produce cannabis for use in his community (Maryland), made a substantial contribution to the national movement for medicinal use," the US government writes. "She provided, in cooperation with the Maryland Attorney General, access to the marijuana plants on which her husband and wife sold their plants, including about 100 plants. On April 12, 2011, Rachel Vassago and her husband paid $500 to $700 from the federal government to help carry out this agreement."

That same day in 2010, Rachel Vassago allegedly sent undercover agents to a home in Maryland and brought the plant she was selling to her husband. According to the order, the agents were able to trace the plants by smelling their plants and taking notes on each plant that they found.

"Rachel was at the same location where her husband was buying cannabis, and she was not arrested," the order reads. "Rachel purchased a hundred and twenty plants for $10 each. That is the amount of cannabis Rachel purchased for use by her husband in the form of his personal possession of marijuana, in accordance with her contract with the United States Attorney."
