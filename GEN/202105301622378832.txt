Dumuzid, the Shepherd

Dumuzid, the Shepherd  of the Sanctuary, has already been released from jail to face accusations of rape by his fellow Shepherd, but it will take a little while before those charges are filed.

In 2012, a jury convicted Jamil Dutt, who was arrested and charged with raping a child in 2015, of the same felony that led him to jail in 2012.

But now, after nearly three years, the girl is finally getting her chance. The teen, who was only 17 at the time, says she's not the first person who's been in a similar situation. But the first of those, who also didn't have a criminal record or any criminal records, says she's the best thing she's ever seen.

"When you're 17 and you don't feel like you have a right to say anything to anyone you feel that you are not safe," the girl said in the video. "I am not gonna give up. And this is an issue for all of us."

The video has been viewed more than 800,000 times.

The couple, who are seeking to have their case dismissed, said in a motion to dismiss that a ruling they filed on Sept. 14 had the effect of closing a federal court "at a reasonable pace," and that the judge had violated her order to vacate the lease.

The ruling by Judge Michael L. J. Brown in the Louisiana Department of Justice lawsuit filed earlier this month in U.S. District Court against the couple, who have been living in the same apartment on the 2800 block of South W.
