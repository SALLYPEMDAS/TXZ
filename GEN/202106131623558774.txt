(You're still in my mouth)  "Yes, I know. No, just stop saying it. I don't mean it's rude, I just need to make sure that you know you want to hear it." "What do you mean?" she said, confused. "Don't let me go. I will explain to you what I do for you. I just need to know what to do with your life. The only person that I can trust to help me, it's you. It's you that I need to save. I feel like I've become so broken and so trapped that you're not being able to be there. It's not your fault, it's not my fault. Just go ahead and tell me you are not hurting any other people and you're going to tell me that you don't know why I am trying to help you. It's okay, I'm just a human being. It's okay. I just need to give you one more chance to get it done. Your life is just a little too precious. It's not going to have any lasting effects on the world. It's just, I will never have enough time to deal with it, okay?" You looked at her, and she smiled, just a little. Her head moved. "Okay. I'll just say what you want me to say. Just let me be you and you will be my best friend." She put her hand to her chest, and her body relaxed, just a little, and you watched her, your eyes closed, as she began to move out of

She put her hand to her chest, and her body relaxed, just a little, and you watched her, your eyes closed, as she began to move out of  that little room. Her hands began to shake, and as she did so, the room suddenly became darker, and the candles began to come out in a brilliant blue light. The light of the candles were illuminating the room, but they were just a tiny part of your body, and they were simply no use to you. Even if you didn't want them, you could still be your best friend. You could let go of what mattered to you. That would mean everything. The last part is you are the one who needs that last bit, and now that it's you, what do you have left to take?

You didn't want to see your friend die. It was as if you had lost yourself in this world as well. You felt the world and felt all you had to do was take it. It was as if you had lost yourself in the process, and your soul had taken a step back from the light and started to return to where it belonged. The light in this world did it for you, it seemed, but it was as if it had no end. It was like the light was finally back, and you felt as if you had taken a step back. It wasn't as if this life that had been around you had suddenly returned to you. It wasn't as if you had lost
