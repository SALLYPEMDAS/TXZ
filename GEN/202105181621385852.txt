The storm began moving slowly along the coast on Wednesday morning as storms slammed into parts of Texas. But the hurricane was still heading west and on its way, as the coast was still heavily packed.

Seahawks wide receiver Kam Chancellor said his club's best hope would be to get out of the hole where it is now and be in the good position to see what the  storm will do to him.

"It's going to be a difficult game, especially not for us," Chancellor said. "If we come out of the hole, we know it's going to be harder to be out in front of our house. I know it's not going to be good for us. I don't think we have a good chance to get out of it

"I'm not in a panic mode, but it was just something to watch out for. It's going to take a lot of work to recover from and get out of here and get into recovery," Chancellor said. "I know it's coming this far but you can't imagine what it is going to do to you."

"I hope we get out," Chancellor said. "We have a couple different guys that could get in this game. One of them, that's probably going to get us out. You know where we are, we're just trying to get out of there and make it out and hopefully get some help or a bit of help. If it does, I
