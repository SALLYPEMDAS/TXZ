Or  on a very large scale, as it were; and so they are both still very active and active.

And I think that if you were to ask me, if I had to give you a list of all my experiences with it, the one that has helped me the most is that, and that would be I have to be as passionate about it as I am about all these things. And I think I would have to start somewhere; and I think I would not be able to. So I think there are, for example, people who think that maybe they can go on and on about these things. Maybe it would be that they were too enthusiastic about it, or they were too concerned about it. Maybe that would make them less interested in the stuff that I'm writing, because maybe they just don't care that much. But if you're thinking of doing it, you can't say, "Oh, I'm just going to do it. Let's get moving." You're not going to be able to do it, you're not going to have all these people who would be like, "Why do you care? It's not me to do it!" What I can tell you is, if you are writing about it, you

What I can tell you is, if you are writing about it, you  really need to care about it and you need to get involved with it. You know, because there are other people who really are very focused on it, and they really want to do it.

And there are people who write about them who write about the stuff that they're writing about, the stuff that they've been reading and it becomes a huge part of their life. And it becomes part of their story. It becomes part of the story because it's part of who they are, because there are people who are passionate about it, and there are people who are concerned about it. And there are people who are worried about what else they're going to read. You know, the people who are interested in it are not doing it. You know, people who write about it, and they're doing it because they've been reading it, because they know it's an amazing story.

And that's why I tell you all of my stories. I tell you this story, and I think that if you're going to write about it, you need to think about the things that you love about it. Because these are stories about people's lives, of their lives and these are stories about them, of their lives. So when you
