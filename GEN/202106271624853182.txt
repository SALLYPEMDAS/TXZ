The owls of the sun
-----

The owls of the sun  are in the north – in the clouds – where they are supposed to live but never do. The clouds do their thing, but the owls of the sun have to leave them to enjoy the warmth of summer.

As the sun gets hotter the owls of the sun become more and more like the birds that they are supposed to resemble and become more like the birds that the sun is supposed to resemble. But that's all, it's all good! It all happens.
