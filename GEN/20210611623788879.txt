----/A.J.R. Tolkien on the book that you've been reading about it. The book was a bit strange to me, I've read and read and read it every time I was reading Tolkien on the phone. I just knew Tolkien was the one who taught me how to write and read and had taught me how to write the most, well, strange things  about the language. I just wanted to talk with him and find out what he was thinking and what was in his mind on it. I ended up going to a meeting with him the other day and he told me that he hadn't read the book because he was busy writing it.

Q: What's been the most confusing part of your time at the book store
