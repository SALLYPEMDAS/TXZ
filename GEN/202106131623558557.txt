(I'm so wet right now)  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"So, the one guy that's still in trouble is… his name's Kaede-chan… his parents' house… his family…?"

I finally managed to convince myself of the possibility of hearing such a serious answer, and I decided to try and keep the thought of a good ending there.

It seems I should tell my own parents that it's about time we get back to the real things.

I decided to go back to work on the shop, and got out of my own way to avoid being caught in my own way.

Even so, I decided to stop the shop.

With the exception of that, I never bothered to think of any of those problems.

To be honest, I don't mind that.

I really feel like that guy is the one who's doing it too.

I finally managed to get a place where I could be used for a rest.

To get out of this kind of predicament, I should try to stop him immediately.

I have no intention of letting a bad fate affect the way I do things.

But I also don't want to think about the things I already know.

And even if it did, I have to understand how and why I do it.

I think this kind of thinking, which I understand, will allow me to be able to make a proper decision on how to go about my business, and so on.

I think this kind of thinking, which I understand, will allow me to be able to make a proper decision on how to go about my business, and so on.
 
I don't want to lose this feeling, and I have no desire to just have a bad ending, but there's only one place I'm going.

So, I was happy that I couldn't do anything at the beginning of the week to make sure it was ok to do that.

I don't want to be put down, or taken down.

I think I should just wait for the time to come when I return to this world, when the things I have worked on become more and more valuable.

I will be doing what I am capable of now, while trying to maintain my sanity.

At this point, it will probably be a while before I can do anything, so I have to be pretty sure about that.

I should really get a job and return to work as soon as possible, and it should be at least as long as possible, since I'll be doing something right away.

What if I don't have that much time left for things, and when the time comes when I'm feeling very stressed, so I do something?

I might have to start working on my business again, in order to make sure I don't fall down.

I think I'll be in such an awkward place now.

I hope I don't fall down this time, and that I don't fall out of work just yet, and maybe just make a few more money, like when I got home from work and went back to school.
