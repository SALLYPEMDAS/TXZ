The Darkest Crusade 

"I'm sorry to hear that you'd want me in your place, but I'm not like you. And I love you so much."


Terrace looked out the window. She hadn't seen her sister since, never seeing her as a person to be with. He'd gone out of his way to be here, to ask her what she would ever look like if she went out there with him. And he had said that he'd never let her go, and he had not expected her to be happy with him.


As he passed her into the hallway, the light from the living room faded. She had no memory of when she went home. The day before, it was like going to the doctor and being told to come home.

Since taking office on April 17, President Obama has given a number of sweeping actions to confront, detain, punish, and indefinitely suspend U.S. military assistance to Israel. Many of the new sanctions, however, do not take into account the realities of the Palestinian Authority and the violence under its rule, which continues to undermine peace  in the Middle East. U.S. and Israeli governments must not support and encourage the actions of some individuals or entities that are considered to be 'terrorist organizations'.


The U.S. and Israel have failed to demonstrate that their commitment to Israel, their willingness to enforce their laws, and their moral values can be respected while upholding international law. The Security Council's permanent review and permanent ban on military and diplomatic activity are in stark contrast to those of both President Obama and President George W. Bush, which began in the wake of the attacks of September 11, 2001.


The Security Council has never given a clear indication that the U.S. would be willing to engage in activities that violate international law that violate human rights, humanitarian law, or the sovereignty of another country, in a way that would constitute a violation of international law. These include the following:


• The continued violation of Israel's human rights laws by the United States (including by its continued policy of aggression in Gaza), which constitute a violation of international law;


• The continued use of illegal military force by U.S. and Israeli forces against Palestinian civilians, including by attacking a non-violent Palestinian protest movement that has been ongoing in Gaza since May 2011;
