cum on my octopus , she's not even human, and she's totally useless. So she just starts throwing insults.

You know what's weird about this whole episode? Because in all those fights and threats, there's never a moment of emotion or anything like that. This is an episode where it's the first fight where something really comes over the scene: There's a huge crowd behind it, and everybody's just standing in the background to give it that feeling. The whole thing felt like an hour long battle between two robots. It's a lot to take in.

I remember this scene. I can remember being very intimidated by it because I knew that I was probably going to be playing a character that was going to take out pretty much every member of the crowd that was on the platform. So I remember thinking, what the hell is this supposed to be? But then, one minute I'm playing my villain and the next minute I'm playing a hero. I mean, who's the hero? And then as soon as my hero character gets up and makes the first move, that's all it took for
