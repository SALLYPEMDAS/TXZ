"That I can see this, that you can see it."


"It is your job to make sure you've got that out of this one!" said Thul-Ra, the Queen of Siam.


"She's got a good feeling in this one, you're glad I'm here to get her help!" she said, with a smile that was a little off-putting. "I'm going to tell her when I'm done and we can go."


Thul-Ra nodded once, in the same moment, and her spirit fluttered over the place where she had been hiding until the two of them returned to the Temple of Siam and the queen of the Siam Clan.
