(You can smell me as you breathe) 

I'm not wearing a skirt.

I'm wearing a skirt in my underwear

I am wearing a skirt to keep up with the day's chores

We have been drinking on the patio. I'm thirsty

I'm drinking like crazy

Heya, you've just heard

I am wearing a skirt to keep up with the day's chores

We have been drinking on the patio. I'm thirsty

I'm drinking like crazy

Heya, you've just heard  my name,

I'm drunk and you want to watch the action

Oh, fuck yes, we're back.

I'm going out for coffee

I'm not going out for a cup of tea

I'm getting out
