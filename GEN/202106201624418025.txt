don't ever forget it.. it's a reminder to you to know how hard it's always been for you to get into trouble. Even when I don't feel comfortable talking about myself to others, I always keep them entertained. As long as they don't hear you. I'll always love you, but when I think about you the most, they'll be all around me..it makes me happy. (pause)

(kiss) You do too. (sigh) How's it been?! It's been a really long time since I've spoken to you. It's been really nice to meet you. Do you want me to take care of you? (kiss) Oh god, this is so nice. (kiss, get off)
