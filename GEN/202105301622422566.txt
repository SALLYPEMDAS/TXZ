the whole world, and with all the nations of the earth. [Isaiah 31:28-29] 


"I have spoken and I will speak, and I will speak, and I will speak, and I will speak. "And it came to pass that I became righteous with the people, and he was his master; and I was his slave. "And I was his master, and I was his slave." [Matthew 16:17-18]

All of our fathers did not agree about "good behavior" and morality. It is the only thing that should be practiced by a man to make a man look good to God and to serve Him.

Even the Bible is very clear that it is only God that is good. Our best and most basic ethical laws have always been the same. The idea of good behavior and morality was the cornerstone for Christianity for a very long time. Today, in every age and nation, the "goodness" of humanity can only be measured in the amount of things that are truly good. Today, all we are seeing is our "soul," our "nature" -- the "soul of God." The good behavior of Christians today is the moral equivalent of what our grandparents looked at the year before.

Christianity's Moral Philosophy

Today, God's "good" has  much more to offer to men than just money, power, and power. And so, in order to meet that need, we must be wise in our behavior, because the world is full of such problems. We should not let our good behavior become just a convenient tool to manipulate and control our people, and to help destroy our civilization.

And it's important to understand that we're also dealing with problems of poverty, terrorism, racism, injustice, war, and even natural disasters. These are the basic ingredients for creating the modern, modern God. We cannot let these problems become "good." In fact, that would be too far of a stretch. We must be better than most people ever imagined ourselves to be.

So, all of you, please join me in praying that God will provide you with the tools to help you grow and prosper. God has already provided you with these tools -- the tools that will keep your people healthy, and well fed.

There are many benefits of being a Christian. I've just recently begun to read the Good News, an article by Paul A. Lippmann on how the Old Testament Church came to know God in two ways.

First, we see the gospel of Jesus Christ through
