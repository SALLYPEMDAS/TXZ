(I'm so hard) 

But don't expect any help to that end from our enemies: we are the ones who destroy them and the ones who kill them.

That is why I will never let my name be held captive.

We all have a reason for keeping these four demons from us.

Therefore, we will not let anyone make any attempt to kill us.

You can kill us for our sins with all your might.

You cannot take control of others with your own will.

It is in this way that we will never be allowed to be.

In my eyes, you must die with dignity and dignity.

Therefore, I will not do you harm.

We will never go to the ends of the earth or leave the world behind us.

There is only one way for us to live, that is for us to die.

And if you don't die with dignity, then you can't become a member of my clan in the near future.

If you don't die with dignity, then don't come in a place you don't want to live.

If you die alone, then I'll not give you a chance to live as an entire family.

You will be the only one who can live in your own backyard.

Because when we go to the other side of the earth, we will not leave a legacy.

And if you don't care about my clan, then you can't live as a family member.

And if you don't care about my clan, then you can't live as a family member. 

Now, after my death, I will take all my clothes off and will keep them on.

It is not possible to be in charge of a clan.

It is like the world has been turned upside down for many generations now.

What I do need is the opportunity to go home and find a family.

If that is possible, then that is the only way.

However, if it is not possible, then I will not give you a chance.

I will be an assassin so that you can find your family.

As long as you are able to find your family, then you will always have me.

I am a man who has no qualms about killing.

But if you want to kill me, then you have to kill me.

You have to kill me.

I will never be the same person in the future.

It's so easy to be the one who will kill you.

No one can ever be the same person in the future.

You should stay on the same side, and if you do not live up to my wishes, then I will kill you in your stead.

For me, the first two chapters will be really painful to write, so please refrain from reading them until we finish.

If you do not want to read the first two chapters, then you should skip to the next one.

The next chapter is really long, but there's enough to give
