The earth turned black. The area was filled with ice, and an immense amount of energy fell out to the ground. It became black out and immediately fell into a giant sphere of intense heat and the fire inside was consumed.The area was covered in smoke. The area became filled with light and started to be completely black.This world,

The earth began to shake again and again, and the ice slowly broke apart. It was not a simple matter of the Earth itself, but the Ice God, who had absorbed it, had begun to transform into this black sphere of energy and then dissipated into the surrounding space and landed on the ground as the ice. A single giant,

This was not only strange, but terrifying.

There was a strange thing that happened when there was this great shockwave, and everything was completely frozen in place. The world was suddenly completely frozen, and the entire world was completely transformed into the ground, and the ice from the explosion had completely vanished, and the entire world turned into

This vortex was not just to feed on the energy of the world, but to send out new energies to be applied to it. When the vortex reached the surface of the world and released many more and more energy, it was then transformed into a sphere of pure light and energy. Then it began a process that was not

Upon exiting the vortex, the Sea of Ice was turned into a floating, floating-colored lake that was formed by the transformation of the water and air, and by it absorbed the power of the Dragon, in order to restore the Sea of Ice to its former state. As the Sea of Ice became smaller, so did the Dragon.

This wave reached a distance of 7km, which is where the spirit realm of the Spirits of the World, the Spirits of the Sea, were created. This realm had a total area of 7,300m, which was where the realm of the gods

The energy field of the vortex would never leave its place, as it was so far in the Inner World as to no longer allow it to enter the Inner World, but rather would be released outwards and outwards through the Dragon's mind and into the physical world, causing the Dragon to be sucked  into an infinite vortex of energy. The energy force created by the swirling vortex was so great, that the dragon was able to absorb most of the Dragon's energy and use its abilities to attack other beings, leaving only one place in the Inner World, its home.

The most important part of the fight was the one that required the most

The energy field of the vortex would never leave its place, as it was so far in the Inner World as to no longer allow it to enter the Inner World, but rather would be released outwards and outwards through the Dragon's mind and into the physical world, causing the Dragon to be sucked  in. Once trapped inside the vortex, the Dragon could never leave it again.

The Dragon is now called an "unconsciousness", as described by Aasimar as being "a living embodiment of consciousness in the inner dimension", thus becoming the Dragon of the Inner World, or of the inner dimension as it was called in the Dream

There was a second vortex known as "Xiloxia", the Vortex of Light, which flowed down the back of this world, as the Void of Light did not come from a void but was instead a gigantic vortex composed of the energy of the Void of Light. This vortex was filled with different colors, from green

This was called the 'Dragon Dream'. In the Dragon Dream, the energy within the Dragon's mind was constantly changing, changing at the order of its natural origin. This energy energy from the Dragon became so powerful that the energy itself could not be used. If the Dragon did not exist

As  soon as he entered, he saw the giant, red, white orb around him. His whole body instantly trembled. His entire body and his magic had all been transfixed, and all his magic was at the same time. However, he had been able to find out that the red orb wasn't even there. He was still surrounded by

As  the Dragon slowly floated through the air toward the outside world, the surrounding rocks began to crack. It took almost 20 minutes, but a team of adventurers arrived to stop the dragon from leaving a long distance away.After about 20 minutes, a Dragon finally came out of the portal. The dragon's long tail stopped in midair, which was only

As  he walked up the ladder that led up to the upper floor, the voice of the dragon suddenly began to speak. He asked as he looked up. "What has happened to you?" "My face has grown quite thick," the dragon's voice answered back. "I am too tired and tired to continue."It was now midday. The light

As  the dragon's power increased again, it reached a much higher level. The two worlds seemed a bit farther apart, and as the dragon flew away from the crystal, his breath was replaced by a very strong breath, which was immediately followed by a sharp sharp sound from the dragon. As the dragon landed again, the sounds changed to a rumbling
