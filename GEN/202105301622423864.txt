The Red Dragon

The Red Dragon  had to stop. In order to make sure everyone got to the party, they were interrupted by the arrival of the others.

In the midst of this, Hachiman stood up and bowed to all his teammates.

"I will take care of you, Mr. Dragon, so I can do what I want. I will do whatever it takes to make sure everyone is safe."

T'ai smiled softly and walked over to T'ai.

"The one who took my daughter to the party is my son, T. Yu-kun. You are my new comrade T'ai-kun. As he is, he should have no problems with me getting into the party. He's going to get your hand first, and I want to get his name right."

T'ai spoke up in a low voice.

"I won't let him get into this, I won't let him get into this. This, is the world's future. I won't let this happen. The one who took my daughter to the party is your new comrade, T. Yu-kun. You will take care of his head as well."

T'ai shook his head.

T'ai shook his head.

"Don 't worry. He will recover very well. I have to take care of the future together."

T'ai turned around as he looked at T'ai.

"T'ai, you look really busy."

T'ai bowed to Hachiman.

Hachiman nodded in agreement.

He didn't even need to remind T'ai of what he was about to do, so Hachiman couldn't even be bothered to be a little disrespectful.

Even though the world couldn't help but pity them, they all felt that Hachiman did something so simple that they felt a little cheated.

"Ah, well. Well then, I've got a bit of some help for you. I can let you watch some videos that we have together."

T'ai had heard that, so he handed Hachiman a chair.

"Now you can watch them and listen to some of the best music you can find and watch some of my more unusual productions on our webstore. It's not something you want to miss."

T'ai watched a few of the videos with a smile on his face.

Hachiman turned around as he walked into
