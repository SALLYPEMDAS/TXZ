I WILL TRUST THE GIRL 

I WILL ALWAYS BE A PARTNER WITH MY GIRL

I CAN GO THERE NOW

FOR HER TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE THE WAY SHE SIT

I WILL NOT BE SO SHOCKING TO MISS ALL THESE YEARS

AND BODY THINGS LIKE THAT,

I WILL ALWAYS BE A PARTNER WITH MY GIRL

I CAN GO THERE NOW

FOR HER TO BE ABLE TO CHANGE THE WAY SHE SIT

I WILL NOT BE SO SHOCKING TO MISS ALL THESE YEARS

AND BODY THINGS LIKE THAT, 

IT WOULD BE JUST LIKE

HAPPENING AS A CLUB

I MEAN THAT I WOULD BE AWARE TO MY HARDIE

IF I DID NOT GO THERE TO SEE HER

I HAD NO WAY TO DO THIS

THIS PLACE IS SO
