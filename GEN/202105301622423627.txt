Lucifuge Rofocale : I love the sound quality, the quality of the music, I really love the voice acting and I really love the overall aesthetic, I really miss the old music, I really miss the past games though. So yes, I really love it. This game's kind of like the old one. I mean, it's not the same but it's a very different game compared to the one in the past, right? But yeah, I love that feeling of nostalgia.

It feels like you're talking about a time where the game was an all-you-can-eat buffet of games and it was all new games and different types of games were going on. What was that feeling like for you?

Yosuke Sato: It was really the time. I think we were both trying to figure out what was going to be the experience and the new things, and in the end it was a really good experience. I think the way we thought about it all was really important for us too to let everything go, so we really had a lot of fun.

It's an all-you-can-eat buffet. The original PlayStation was all new games, it was all new experiences, it was all new types of games

It's an all-you-can-eat buffet. The original PlayStation was all new games, it was all new experiences, it was all new types of games  so much of the story went from that. The only thing I could remember about it was the original soundtrack that it was released on, in this country it was an old series song, I was playing the songs for a band called "No, You'll Not Be Alone" that we started playing, "Sail Away", it was kind of a game that was very similar to the previous games, it was basically about getting back into the comfort zone of life that was so much better than the previous games. I was like, "Yo, we gotta be able to play this game. How did you do it?" and "Oh, that's what I was supposed to do it was this. I'm just trying to survive." So I just played with it, as it was a huge joy to play the game. But yeah, it was a very different feeling, and it was definitely a new experience.

So what's your take on the old ones?

Yosuke Sato: As you can imagine, I think for me, the nostalgic thing that comes along with it. I mean, the time where I heard "Sail Away" was such a different experience, a lot of nostalgic sounds and games that were playing there, and
