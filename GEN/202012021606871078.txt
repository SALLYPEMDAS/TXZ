This is the only thing that keeps Republicans from declaring they want Trump to become president, and now that's about to happen.

Here's the truth: Trump has never been a billionaire and did not make $20 million in the form of real estate investments. His stock has also not been worth  a lot of money, having been traded in at least six states as of this writing, most notably in Pennsylvania, which is a state Trump won by 5 percentage points. And all but a few billionaires own stocks valued anywhere from $1,500 to $2,000.

His business interests include hedge funds and law firms and construction contractors and investment banks and real estate companies. So he's probably a wealthy man and he

Here's the truth: Trump has never been a billionaire and did not make $20 million in the form of real estate investments. His stock has also not been worth  as much as he'd be in a Trump presidency, according to Forbes.

And what he did is a bit more remarkable: Trump's family has invested in a variety of companies in the United States. Trump owned companies such as Boeing, General Motors, General Electric, Exxon Mobil, General Motors, Bank of America, PepsiCo, Starbucks, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Chicago Cubs, according to Forbes.

Here's the truth: Trump has never been a billionaire and did not make $20 million in the form of real estate investments. His stock has also not been worth  that much. His other assets include luxury apartments and other properties that are being sold for less than the value of what he would have spent on them (the Clintons, for example, own up to $2.4 million). All of those assets are being sold at a massive discount to the money he will never use and, if the Trump Organization could possibly sell them at any time for less than it would if he hadn't invested

This is the only thing that keeps Republicans from declaring they want Trump to become president, and now that's about to happen.

Here's the truth: Trump has never been a billionaire and did not make $20 million in the form of real estate investments. His stock has also not been worth  more than $300 million. Trump has paid in excess of $5 million in federal tax subsidies, but that money went toward his legal team and not his campaign.

If Trump were to become president, we would all lose.

As it happened, all the parties agreed to nominate Florida's 45th governor, Rick Scott. If Scott had accepted the nomination and been nominated to succeed Scott, he would have the support

Here's the truth: Trump has never been a billionaire and did not make $20 million in the form of real estate investments. His stock has also not been worth  much — and there are real estate investors out there that want that too. But it's a new, bold, ambitious agenda and his recent "pivot" to Asia and China are a reminder that while he may be a real estate tycoon and a billionaire, Trump has always been a populist. And that means he won't be able to bring the country together by pushing his agenda in areas where it's not working well.

Here's the truth: Trump has never been a billionaire and did not make $20 million in the form of real estate investments. His stock has also not been worth  more than $50,000, but it's very difficult to say whether he has a better grasp of the rules of international trade, financial services, and the law of international economics than the Wall Street Journal's Brian Hayes.

How much of that is money is unclear. That money, as you know, is subject to an internal review by each party. And the process is different for each. But one thing is clear

Here's the truth: Trump has never been a billionaire and did not make $20 million in the form of real estate investments. His stock has also not been worth  more than $1 million in 2016.

This is just the latest in a series of media claims, including that Republicans plan to repeal and replace Obamacare in 2018, and that Trump can become president if Republicans elect Trump the next President.

I asked Marco Rubio, one of my GOP friends, about this last week. He said it was only the first of several, if any, of his own attempts at a political

Here's the truth: Trump has never been a billionaire and did not make $20 million in the form of real estate investments. His stock has also not been worth  more than $10 million.

He is not going to be a billionaire. Nor is he going to be the largest donor to Democratic candidates. He has no plans to become president unless he becomes president of the United States.

But he does seem to be in the process of making that happen.

If you read the Wall Street Journal column, you'll see that Donald Trump is running against Hillary Clinton for president

You look at what I did, I did great. I'm going to build a great wall. And I have a great plan for rebuilding our country. And I don't  want to put that on anybody's mind. I don't think we need to wait until next year, because the Republicans have an agenda they want to move forward with for a year. And the next year, they have two agenda. The next year, they have a plan of priorities. And now I hope the Republicans will come together and make sure they make those plans.

I didn't change the strategy when I did the deal. It's going to come back to the negotiating table, to what I've done.

I don't want to get into the specifics, because you could easily get confused with the campaign. But I'm not going to go into this without a sense of this in my mind. I think in particular this election is going to be a big focus for our Democratic Party, because we have a whole swath of the country and a whole swath of people that are going to vote for this president. It just  doesn't feel natural to you to think about that. You're not going to be surprised that we have all these different constituencies in this country.

But here's the thing about this, where it becomes a campaign issue. That is this person was not a representative, that he has no support within a third of the national and statewide Democratic Party base. He's not running a campaign, he's not a primary supporter,

They are all young people. They all want to be part of the future. They all want to be a part of a future that is the American way.

I don't want to get into the specifics, because you could easily get confused with the campaign. But I'm not going to go into this without a sense of this in my mind. I think in particular this election is going to be a big focus for our Democratic Party, because we have a whole swath of the country and a whole swath of people that are going to vote for this president. It just  goes to show, really, that people care. They feel supported. They feel validated. And you know, I'm not saying it's for everyone, but it's really important to take care of a lot of the issues and support issues that people care about, whether you care about Social Security, tax reform, health care, and so forth.

It just  goes to show how we can win that people are working hard to win.

QUESTION: Now, I don't know what that means for Donald Trump. I've seen him before, so I understand. But I just want to ask you that when he first announced, in May of 2012, the campaign for the Republican Party, and when it was formed, does that not resonate across the country, and where does the

I don't want to get into the specifics, because you could easily get confused with the campaign. But I'm not going to go into this without a sense of this in my mind. I think in particular this election is going to be a big focus for our Democratic Party, because we have a whole swath of the country and a whole swath of people that are going to vote for this president. It just  doesn't get much deeper than that. The way we're going to win is by having the next guy who runs for president. That's one of the things I've said many times. We need someone with vision, someone who believes in a system that's fair and what we stand for.

Q: Do you think Hillary Clinton's supporters, if you look at what they've said about Sanders in the past, would

I don't want to get into the specifics, because you could easily get confused with the campaign. But I'm not going to go into this without a sense of this in my mind. I think in particular this election is going to be a big focus for our Democratic Party, because we have a whole swath of the country and a whole swath of people that are going to vote for this president. It just  doesn't feel right to say this is something we're going to run, where it will be a struggle, and that won't be right by anybody's standards. It won't feel right to say that Hillary Clinton is an opponent like that. It doesn't feel right to say it will be a primary or caucus, and that's not how it's done.

I don't want to get into the specifics, because you could easily get confused with the campaign. But I'm not going to go into this without a sense of this in my mind. I think in particular this election is going to be a big focus for our Democratic Party, because we have a whole swath of the country and a whole swath of people that are going to vote for this president. It just  feels like the most fundamental political choice to me.

So it's going to be a very tight race going into this year. It's very, very tight. I think it's a very close race between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. So it's going to have a very deep impact on the nation.

QUESTION: In this campaign, you've called for the president to resign. Why is he doing this

I don't want to get into the specifics, because you could easily get confused with the campaign. But I'm not going to go into this without a sense of this in my mind. I think in particular this election is going to be a big focus for our Democratic Party, because we have a whole swath of the country and a whole swath of people that are going to vote for this president. It just  so happens that we're both the party of billionaires and corporations and Wall Street, so we are going to be on the front lines as we have to defend America's future. So for me, the most important thing for us is for people in the White House, particularly working families and middle class, to get behind the policies that will bring about the economic security and economic prosperity of this country, that will lift people out of poverty

It's the last thing you'd expect in Washington.

It's going to be hard to keep it going when the Democratic Party's most powerful man -- Donald Trump -- is in a new campaign mode.

Trump has been on a roll with his campaign, his rallies, his media appearances, his interviews, his media conference speeches,  his meetings with senators, and even his personal appearances with major media figures.

The New York Times reported Sunday that Trump has been a key player in the campaign, and in several interviews on the campaign trail, he has made it clear that he will not run, despite several attempts.

For instance, while some may wonder what could have happened if Trump and his campaign hadn't made a big move to hold on to

It's the last thing you'd expect in Washington.

It's going to be hard to keep it going when the Democratic Party's most powerful man -- Donald Trump -- is in a new campaign mode.

Trump has been on a roll with his campaign, his rallies, his media appearances, his interviews, his media conference speeches,  his business trips and even his public statements. He has yet to win a single delegate, and his latest stumble came while Trump was still president.

But the real estate mogul is taking the stage as usual, with the kind of fervor a normal New Yorker would take for his prime-time address. And his fans are just as enthusiastic about it.

So, the first question that many of his supporters must ask

It's the last thing you'd expect in Washington.

It's going to be hard to keep it going when the Democratic Party's most powerful man -- Donald Trump -- is in a new campaign mode.

Trump has been on a roll with his campaign, his rallies, his media appearances, his interviews, his media conference speeches,  and, of course, his political rallies.

His new campaign strategy has been to use a new group of political professionals to fill out a series of media interviews and television interviews. But as we have seen, in the last week or so, the Republicans, especially Trump, have used a new, new group of political consultants to provide them with special access to Trump's supporters.

This new group of political professionals is

Trump has been on a roll with his campaign, his rallies, his media appearances, his interviews, his media conference speeches,  his meetings with billionaires. But there is no longer any reason to hold the President accountable.

This is all in a new way: With an unpredictable President who has been in the media for years, has been seen as a surrogate, as an enemy.

Here's a sampling of what the GOP's latest presidential contenders have said about Trump and his temperament since his election, which ended up costing Hillary Clinton the nomination.

 TRUMP, 'THE PAST' FOR PRESIDENT, JULY 29, 2016

It's the last thing you'd expect in Washington.

It's going to be hard to keep it going when the Democratic Party's most powerful man -- Donald Trump -- is in a new campaign mode.

Trump has been on a roll with his campaign, his rallies, his media appearances, his interviews, his media conference speeches,  and his first 100 days in office.

Trump has managed to keep the GOP on its toes. It's just that, even when it has its problems, the party is often just as vulnerable to sabotage and spin from the party establishment as ever before.

To defeat him, the Trump team should focus on a very different challenge in which Hillary Clinton has come into the White House, which is the fight over what to

It's the last thing you'd expect in Washington.

It's going to be hard to keep it going when the Democratic Party's most powerful man -- Donald Trump -- is in a new campaign mode.

Trump has been on a roll with his campaign, his rallies, his media appearances, his interviews, his media conference speeches,  and now his official schedule.

With the exception of a few short-lived television appearances, Trump has not released more than a month in office. It's unclear when he'll be back in his penthouse West Wing. He hasn't given an official timeline for his travel plans.

Trump's plan for his first 100 days of presidency has been nothing short of a scorched earth policy.

It's the last thing you'd expect in Washington.

It's going to be hard to keep it going when the Democratic Party's most powerful man -- Donald Trump -- is in a new campaign mode.

Trump has been on a roll with his campaign, his rallies, his media appearances, his interviews, his media conference speeches,  and, most recently, his last meeting with an American Muslim leader, a time-limited, largely symbolic, campaign event that ended with a small crowd that was apparently not aware of what transpired.

With his announcement on Wednesday of his administration's plan to close the most controversial Islamic travel ban in U.S. history, Trump now has a shot at clinching the presidency.

And while he's not likely to

"We're going to have to move beyond this and figure out how we can better leverage our resources to accomplish this, particularly when the Republicans are controlling the House," Trump said at a New York rally on Monday.

Republicans have been reluctant to offer any deal on the future of the healthcare reform law, which Republicans have called a major economic disaster. Many have pushed for more aggressive reforms to the health care system,

"It is so much more important to have the Republicans do what they can to elect a Republican president," Trump said Friday. "The best way to do that is to have a Republican controlled Congress, and if they can win that House in November, that's a real victory."

While he said he's not sure how it could work, Trump would like to take his chances in an already busy legislative session.

But there will still be  "no formal meeting with the President" because of Trump's recent comments and remarks criticizing Clinton.

Trump, who appeared to be having a hard time wrapping his head around the news that former President Bill Clinton used a private email server as secretary of state, has yet to release a statement since his first news conference on Tuesday.

I am reading your book. I understand how you feel. I am not writing to try to get a reply from him. I am writing to help you through the hard times of those hard  times, so please understand that this is your last wish.


As to the matter of the meeting with the Russians, I don't know. But as for the matter of the phone call you sent me, well I have only heard nothing about it. I am not at liberty to do that.


Mr. Trump, you are a businessman, and you are the personification of that business with all the great companies

I think the administration, in doing their job and trying to do what's best for America, it will go very, very wrong and probably could lead to a world where the planet isn't livable."

Sessions did not offer a timeline for when he  could leave or how that decision might be made. On Friday, Trump ordered the Department of Homeland Security to begin providing the White House with more information about what he's doing on the issue.

Asked for comment about the order, Deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement that Sessions had "no comment" at this time on Sessions' potential announcement.

Sessions has said during his confirmation hearings that

I think the administration, in doing their job and trying to do what's best for America, it will go very, very wrong and probably could lead to a world where the planet isn't livable."

Sessions did not offer a timeline for when he  could announce the new administration, or whether he was confident that the decision would be made by next month. But it is unclear whether Sessions would be required to attend a closed meeting with the president next week.

"We're going to have a pretty solid decision in due course," Sessions said of the new administration. "I can't promise you there won't be any announcements at the meeting, we'll just hear what the

Sessions did not offer a timeline for when he  would replace Pruitt. But the senator said he would continue working on a report into the agency's handling of the Dakota Access Pipeline.

"I think it's clear there is something there with respect to the process we're going through to get this done, but I know there are some things left to do," he said.

The Senate panel also released a new report late Friday to examine the administration's "systemic

I think the administration, in doing their job and trying to do what's best for America, it will go very, very wrong and probably could lead to a world where the planet isn't livable."

Sessions did not offer a timeline for when he  would release the documents, but suggested the White House could try to obtain a waiver.

"It's very likely to happen at some point," he said. "A lot of people are looking for any waiver that might allow us to get around a lot of the other things that we need to get out of this that might affect the way that we build our economy."

The report, however, was based on private

Sessions did not offer a timeline for when he 'd be released from his own prison.

In a statement, Sessions indicated the U.S. needs to find a way to deal with "the vast amount of crime that threatens American lives in this country."

He also said that "these are troubling times for the president and his administration."

"In the past, the president has tried to address the problem of racial inequality and the issues around drug and mental

I think the administration, in doing their job and trying to do what's best for America, it will go very, very wrong and probably could lead to a world where the planet isn't livable."

Sessions did not offer a timeline for when he  intends to change the rule. But he also stressed that the rule would apply to only three agencies.

"I would say, 'If I have to say so, what I'm going to do is go down that path,'" he said.

Sessions also said he wants to see the administration address climate change, which he said the current administration had not tackled.

Sessions did not offer a timeline for when he  would launch the new round of sanctions. He did not say when he would deliver his comments to Trump. Trump had earlier warned against imposing any sanctions on Syria, which he has characterized as a "strategic threat."

The Senate will have to approve the resolution before it becomes law in October and Obama administration officials said in a statement after the vote that they could consider changes.

Democrats have opposed a ban on U.

Sessions did not offer a timeline for when he  would rule out a second White House run, though he did point to a possibility it might be during the next presidential election season.

As for the question of the first, he told the Senate Judiciary Committee during his confirmation hearing Tuesday he believes the American people will have a better choice when it comes to government.
