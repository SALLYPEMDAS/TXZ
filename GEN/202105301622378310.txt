Ants use their wings to get up on  their prey to jump on them in pursuit of them while their body is still moving, so a little bit of strength can be a big advantage when trying to hunt small prey like big birds. They are very good climbers with long feet.


They can get up on their prey with a bit of muscle movement, especially during a quick flight like a deer.
