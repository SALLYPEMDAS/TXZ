Chapter 2: Birds  Of New York

The game was played with both the New York and Brooklyn Nets playing with a 4.5-game lead in the Eastern Conference standings. The game started off with some heavy defensive play from the Nets led by DeMarre Carroll who was able to find some scoring opportunities for himself. After a few minutes of heavy hitting from the Knicks, the game would become more balanced with teams moving out and out.

The game was capped off by a pair of 3-pointers by J.R. Smith that led to a pair of 3-pointers by DeMarre Carroll to tie the game up at two. The game would be tied up at one when the Nets would need to make a play to get into the game to try and keep the score close and get a win.

After a short break, DeMarre Carroll scored a pair of free throws to put New York up nine. The Knicks would score three more points to bring the lead up to ten heading into the second quarter of the game. The game would go down to the wire in the final minute of the half
