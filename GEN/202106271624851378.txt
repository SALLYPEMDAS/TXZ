Who LARPs with the Snowmen? 

Yes.

What is the Snowball?

It is a device like a snowblower that is used to turn snow from the sky in a fashion that is more efficient than a standard snowplow.

How do you create the snow?

With a large, thick, soft piece of ice the snow is turned up into a huge plow. The plow then takes the ice from the machine and pushes it into the snow to be turned. That is the actual operation of the machine. But you can also turn snow down into a big pile and then use it as a plow with a similar appearance.

What does it make of?

The Snowball can turn snow from several different colors and patterns. You will want to choose and plan a snow plow for your project so that you are getting exactly the colors and patterns you want. It is always best to buy your snow machine as long as you can keep it in working order.

You also can use your snow machine in your back yard if you have some.

Does the Snowball work?

Yes!

Where can I see one on the market?

Yes, you can buy one right now at the American Snowmobile Association's online store.

What is the snowmobile market like today?
