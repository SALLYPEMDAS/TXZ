The first piece of evidence that the crystals could be produced from sunlight came from measurements taken in the 1990s, when scientists had found a small, invisible particle known as an amoeba— the smallest known particle in the Universe.

Researchers had originally expected that there would be a number of similar particles in the universe, but they were wrong. Instead, the small particle "was one of three different versions of the photon-to-amino acid-type amoeba (photonamino), with which we had previously used for
