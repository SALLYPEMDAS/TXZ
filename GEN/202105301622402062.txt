In this game, the player takes the role of Aikido Detective in his first two-day patrol, and is tasked with getting the Killer Killer off the streets, which ends up killing him in the process.

At the same time that he is on the street and has to run, he gets caught in a car, and he's stuck in traffic for hours. He's not quite sure how he can escape, so the game makes it seem like he's a little more dangerous than he actually is.

During one of the endings in the Super Mario Run version, if you talk to Aikido Detective in his car, he will tell you, "The man got hit by my car… He shot the guy in the head." Also, the protagonist gets an invitation to join him on his patrol, which turns out to be the first of its kind in Super Mario 64. In other words, the two of them met before Super Mario 64 was released; the other player gets an invitation for a second time.

In Super Mario 64, Aikido Detective gives you the Joker, a unique  character who has only his own character, the name of which sounds a little too familiar. After beating his first round of Aikido Detective, you're able to get the nickname for the second time, which in turn leads you to the "Criminal" (though that can still happen in other games, but that is another story). After beating his final round of Aikido Detective, you get to take him out for a drink, though you must avoid him to get the job done.

When you pick up the game from a store near you on the third day, he is sitting at the vending machine next to you, while a young girl takes a few photos of him. During the credits he is seen drinking and eating a Coke. During one final chase, he is seen in a car. The game makes him the last person to take the Joker's place before he's killed.

In Super Mario 64 and Super Mario 64 DS, Aikido Detective can be killed if you die. He is also a very strong antagonist in the game, as he is capable of using any method and
