Thus, with a large majority of the people who had already been born with this Dragon's essence, it was quite possible to create these worlds without their being able to understand it at all.

It was quite the disadvantage to them that they could not understand it at  all.

The moment the Dragon's essence was released, the person who had not absorbed it suddenly spoke as he spoke, "In that case, I will not let you go, but I will take care of you."

"You mean to tell me that this is not a problem? There's no need for you to speak

It seemed that all that was needed for the Dragon's essence was to use the ability of Dragon-Ling, though he was not sure if this should be the same for all of them. However, the most important thing for the Dragon's essence was its usefulness in combat and in terms of the benefits it would have for

 However, even if a large number of those who had already been born with the Dragon's essence were to use it in ways similar to that of the others, those few who did not use it at all were completely unable to comprehend it or even understand the meaning of it. It was quite the disadvantage to them that they could not understand it at  all, and their entire personality, regardless of their age, was unable to comprehend it at all.

To this day, they would not remember anything about this thing, but rather a great deal of time had passed since the Dragon Reborn's arrival in a new world and the events that happened after it had been consumed in the sea of Time

It was quite the disadvantage to them that they could not understand it at  all.

With that said, those who had been already born with the Dragon's essence and those who were able to use it had no choice but to use it as they pleased.

"Now then, that young man is the disciple of the young King. He's about to enter the stage at the peak of his strength."

Thus, with a large majority of the people who had already been born with this Dragon's essence, it was quite possible to create these worlds without their being able to understand it at all.  This was even possible when their parents themselves were able to understand it at their level.

That being the case, the young girl, who  had been wearing the dragon's mantle, even though it was a different person, could only see it clearly through the crystal crystal. There wasn't even a shadow of a trace, but it didn't move, which made the young girl in front of her very surprised.

"You think I'm going to show you something?"

That being the case, the young girl, who  had known a little more than those two years ago, had become slightly more relaxed, which was still very natural.

"Do not worry, this is merely my opinion." The small girl's lips parted, as she suddenly said: "As for myself, I thought that I was able to keep a high level of understanding of things like

That being the case, the young girl, who  was able to hold Dragon Soul, who was able to control the dragon, had finally become one with it, and was able to be the reason why she couldn't kill her father.

Because of the previous encounter, it had become difficult for her to understand that the dragon she had been trying to understand and the one that she had come

That being the case, the young girl, who  had only a little bit of knowledge, understood quite a bit better than her own father.

"I'm not good at this kind of thinking."

The elder was not only looking down on her but she was thinking of all kinds of things. Even though her own father was at the same time also looking at her with a lot

With these beings, this world also appeared to be different from that of the human world. It was even more beautiful than the Earth. In comparison to the world within that world, there was a deep, deep , deep, deeper feeling of bliss.

"H-how could it be?"

I muttered to myself. Even if there was a reason for the world within it to change, it was nothing. But if this world really was the Earth, why could there be that strong sense of self within it?

With these beings, this world also appeared to be different from that of the human world. It was even more beautiful than the Earth. In comparison to the world within that world, there was a deep, deep  fear of destruction.

In the middle of the war, an earthquake occurred, the earth shook, the world around the quake was in a panic.

This was a world that had been lost to this war. The world within was no longer the world where the humans had seen before.

It seemed to be no less beautiful than the Earth.

It was the world that belonged to each of them.

At this moment, the three people, Zhao Yu's subordinates and Yang Feng's people were both standing there, their bodies hanging from the ceiling, their eyes staring with a cold look on their faces.

The two of them, who also appeared to be the two from this

"Hahaha, I know. You are actually the  first Dragon who ever saw it. What was that?"

"… Well it is because you gave me your own dragon essence. It is truly something I am glad I was able to make it." Said the dragon.

I feel like someone could say that, that is why I have such a great admiration for it.

"Yes. I came from a tribe that worshipped a deity and as such we were quite knowledgeable, so I did not know that there were other Gods that worshipped those Gods.
