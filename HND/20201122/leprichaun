                    THIS HAS BEEN PASSED DOWNFROM THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO
                    FROM MY GREAT-GREAT-GRANDFATHERWHO WAS IRISH.

                    WILL GET YOU ON THE NEWS.
                    BUT BELIEVING IN EVOLUTIONWILL GET YOU LYNCHED.
                    THIS IS THE GONE WITH THE WIND OF INTERNET VIDEOS.
                    IT'S OLD,IT'S FAMOUS,
                    AND IT MAKES THE SOUTHLOOK TERRIBLE.
                    THERE ISN'T A LEPRECHAUN THERE,
                    BECAUSE NO TINY WHITE MANCOULD SURVIVE IN THE HOOD
                    FOR LONGER THANTHREE MINUTES.
                    AND IF THERE WAS A TREASURE,
                    IT WOULD ALREADY BE MAILED INTO CASH 4 GOLD.
                    GUESS HOW MANYMYTHICAL BEASTS
                    ARE SPOTTED EVERY YEARIN L.A. AND NEW YORK?
                    ZERO.
                    BECAUSE WE'RE EDUCATED.
                    IF YOU'RE POOR, YOU NEED TO HAVEA STRONG IMAGINATION.
                    YOU KNOW WHAT'S MORE RARETHAN A UNICORN?
                    A RICH PERSON DEVOTINGTHEIR LIFE TO FINDING BIGFOOT.
                    EVERY CULTURE HAS THEIR OWNMADE-UP NIGHTMARES.
                    MEXICANS HAVE CHUPACABRA.
                    THE CHINESE HAVE DRAGONS.
                    WHITE PEOPLEHAVE BLACK PEOPLE.
                    AND WOMEN HAVEROMANTIC COMEDIES.
                    LISTEN, I DON'T CAREHOW MUCH I ENJOYED
                    GOING THE DISTANCE.
                    NO MAN MOVESACROSS THE COUNTRY
                    FOR A MID-30s DREW BARRYMORE.
                    NONE OF THESE CREATURES EXIST.
                    IF THEY DID, WE WOULD HAVECAPTURED THEM YEARS AGO
                    AND TORTURED THEM IN ZOOSFOR OUR OWN AMUSEMENT.
                    I DO KNOW THE LOCH NESS MONSTERIS ALIVE AND WELL,
                    BECAUSE IT LIVES IN MY PANTS.
                    AND IT'S BEEN SPOTTEDSUNBATHING ON MY BALLS.
                    THE ONLY REAL MONSTERSIN THE WORLD
                    ARE THE MOMSFROM TODDLERS &amp; TIARAS.
